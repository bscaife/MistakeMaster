Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does spring force always act vertically?,Only in freefall,"No, it acts along the axis of the spring regardless of orientation","Yes, it always points up",Only when mass is attached,B,"Spring force acts along the spring’s direction, which can be horizontal, vertical, or at an angle."
What determines the direction of spring force?,The orientation of the spring and its displacement,The mass attached,The temperature,Only gravity,A,The force follows the axis of compression or extension.
"If a spring is mounted horizontally and stretched, which way is the force?",Along the horizontal axis of the spring,Upward,It has no force,Downward,A,Spring force restores equilibrium — here it acts along the x-axis.
Which best describes the direction of spring force?,It follows the direction of weight,It is always directed along the spring,It pulls to the side,It is always upward,B,"Springs act to restore their original shape, pulling or pushing along their length."
What happens if a spring is compressed diagonally?,It points toward gravity,It cancels,The force points diagonally along the spring,It goes vertical,C,The restoring force acts along the same diagonal axis.
What kind of force is exerted by a spring stretched horizontally?,Only weight,A vertical force,A restoring force directed horizontally,No force,C,Spring force = −k·x along axis of stretch.
Why is it incorrect to say spring force is always vertical?,Because mass floats,Because vertical forces are stronger,Because spring tension is downward,Because the spring can be oriented in any direction,D,Spring force direction is defined by how the spring is stretched or compressed.
"k = 150 N/m, stretched 0.3 m horizontally. What is the force direction?","Horizontal, opposite to stretch",No direction,Vertical,Diagonal,A,"Spring force is always directed along axis — here, horizontal."
A spring is angled 45° and stretched 0.2 m. In what direction is the force?,Downward,Along the 45° angle,Horizontal,Upward,B,Force always acts along the spring axis.
Two springs are aligned vertically and horizontally. Which direction do they apply force?,Both vertical,Both downward,Neither applies force,Along their respective axes,D,Each spring acts along its own orientation.
