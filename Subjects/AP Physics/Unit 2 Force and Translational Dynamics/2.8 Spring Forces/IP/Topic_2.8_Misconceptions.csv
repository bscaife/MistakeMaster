Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH85,Springs always exert upward force,"Assumes springs always push up, not recognizing they can pull or push depending on how they're stretched or compressed."
PH86,Springs exert constant force,"Thinks spring force is constant regardless of stretch, ignoring that force depends on displacement from equilibrium (Hookeâ€™s Law)."
PH87,Spring force depends on mass,Believes that heavier objects result in stronger springs regardless of how much the spring is stretched.
PH88,The relaxed length is arbitrary,Does not understand that spring force depends on how far the spring is stretched from its natural (relaxed) length.
PH89,Compressed springs store no energy,"Thinks springs must be stretched to do work or store energy, not realizing compression also stores potential energy."
PH90,The spring force is always vertical,"Assumes spring force acts only up/down like gravity, ignoring that it acts along the axis of the spring."
PH91,The direction of spring force is the same as motion,"Mistakes the direction of spring force as always aligned with motion, rather than toward the equilibrium position."
