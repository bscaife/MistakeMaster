Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
An object doesn’t move. Does this mean no force acts?,Only if it floats,"No, forces may be balanced",Only with friction,"Yes, motion means force",B,Object may be in equilibrium: forces present but canceling.
Which situation has real forces but no motion?,A magnet flying,A book resting on a table,A rock falling,A ball rolling,B,Normal and gravity cancel — still real and measurable.
Why can an object be still even with forces acting?,Net force is zero,Forces reverse direction,Friction is negative,It repels gravity,A,Balanced forces → no acceleration (Newton’s first law).
Which of the following is true in static equilibrium?,Only gravity acts,No forces exist,Only massless objects qualify,Forces are real and balanced,D,Forces must be equal and opposite to result in no motion.
How can you detect invisible forces?,By measuring interaction,Only with motion,Only in friction,Only when mass changes,A,"Forces may be unseen but still produce tension, pressure, or support."
Why is it wrong to say 'no force' if object doesn’t move?,Motion depends on net force,All objects float,Only visible forces matter,Force requires sound,A,Forces exist even without motion — net force = 0 is a valid case.
A person stands still. What forces act?,Only gravity,Gravity and normal force,None,Air resistance,B,"Gravity pulls down, floor pushes up — net force is zero, but forces still act."
Block sits at rest. m = 4 kg. Normal force?,19.6 N,39.2 N,4 N,0 N,B,Fₙ = weight = m·g = 4·9.8 = 39.2 N upward.
Hanging object at rest. Tension = ?,Greater than mg,Depends on angle,0,Equal to weight,D,Tension balances weight → equal magnitude.
Net force = 0. Acceleration = ?,0,It depends,Nonzero,9.8,A,Fₙₑₜ = 0 → a = 0 (Newton’s 2nd law).
