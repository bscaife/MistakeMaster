Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
When is tension the same throughout a string?,Always,Only when vertical,When the string is massless and frictionless,Only in equilibrium,C,"Tension is constant only in ideal, massless, frictionless strings."
Why can tension vary in a system?,Speed changes,It depends on pressure,Mass or friction causes imbalance,Force only acts at ends,C,Real ropes with mass or systems with friction have unequal tension.
Which part of a rope might have lower tension?,At the top,In vacuum,Near the moving object,In the middle,C,Tension is affected by acceleration and friction near pulling mass.
Two blocks are connected over a pulley. Is tension equal?,Only if pulley is ideal,"Yes, always",Only with gravity,Only when string is short,A,Frictionless pulley + massless string → equal tension both sides.
"In a vertical rope holding a mass, what is tension at the top vs. bottom?",Greater at top if rope has mass,It cancels,Larger at bottom,Equal everywhere,A,"With mass, tension accumulates from the top down."
Why might tension change in a long rope?,Only vertical length matters,Friction reverses tension,Rope’s weight adds to force,Ropes absorb motion,C,Mass of rope adds force as you go down.
"In a tug-of-war, why is tension equal on both sides of the rope?",Rope moves faster,Direction stays same,They pull with equal force,Weight cancels,C,Equal opposing pulls → constant tension in center of ideal rope.
Mass m = 2 kg hangs from a rope. Tension = ?,9.8 N,4.9 N,19.6 N,2 N,C,T = m·g = 2 × 9.8 = 19.6 N.
"Mass = 5 kg, rope has 2 kg evenly spread. Tension at top?",0,More than 49 N,Equal to 49 N,Less than 49 N,B,Tension at top includes mass of object and rope → > 5·9.8.
Pulley system with equal masses and ideal rope. Tension in string?,More on left,Zero on one side,More on right,Same on both sides,D,Ideal rope + ideal pulley → tension is constant throughout.
