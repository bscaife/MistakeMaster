Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"In an interaction, which object feels more force?",The smaller one,Neither — forces are equal,The faster one,The heavier one,B,"Newton’s third law: forces are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction."
"If a small object accelerates more in a collision, why?",It started moving earlier,Its mass increases,It receives more force,"It has less mass, not more force",D,Equal force + smaller mass → greater acceleration (F = ma).
Which best explains different accelerations during a force pair interaction?,Unequal forces,Different masses,Different directions,Air resistance,B,Mass is the variable — force is the same on both objects.
Two people push off each other. One accelerates more. Why?,They are lighter,They are faster,They feel more force,Gravity helps,A,Same force → lighter person accelerates more (F = ma).
Which law explains why different masses accelerate differently?,W = mg,a = v²/r,p = mv,F = ma,D,Force is shared — acceleration varies based on mass (F = ma).
"If object A accelerates less than B during a collision, what must be true?",The system is unbalanced,B pushed harder,A feels more force,A has more mass,D,Equal force → more mass = less acceleration.
"In Newton’s third law, how are acceleration and mass related?",Exponentially,Not at all,Inversely,Directly,C,Same force → smaller mass = larger acceleration (a = F/m).
Force = 10 N on 2 kg and 5 kg objects. Which accelerates more?,Neither moves,Same,2 kg object,5 kg object,C,a = F/m → 10/2 = 5 m/s² vs 10/5 = 2 m/s².
Two skaters push off. 40 kg skater gets 3 m/s². What force?,80 N,12 N,160 N,120 N,D,F = m·a = 40 × 3 = 120 N (also on the other skater).
Same force on 3 kg and 6 kg carts. Which accelerates more?,6 kg cart,Neither,3 kg cart,Both stay still,C,a = F/m → less mass = more acceleration.
