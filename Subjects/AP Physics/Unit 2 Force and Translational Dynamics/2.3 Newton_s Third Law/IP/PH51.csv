Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
When do action and reaction forces occur?,Only when balanced,Simultaneously,With a time delay,Only if one object moves,B,Newton’s third law states forces occur at the same time.
You push a wall. When does it push back?,Immediately,Only if it breaks,When motion starts,After a delay,A,Action and reaction happen simultaneously.
Two skaters push off each other. When do they feel force?,One after the other,Only when balanced,When one moves faster,At the exact same time,D,Equal and opposite forces are instant and mutual.
"In Newton’s third law, how are forces related?","Different size, delayed",One stronger than the other,Only present in collisions,"Equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, simultaneous",D,Forces are always paired and occur at the same time.
Can reaction force happen after the action force?,"Yes, if motion delays",Only with springs,Only with friction,"No, they are simultaneous",D,Both forces occur together in any interaction.
Why do action-reaction forces seem unequal?,The lighter object acts slower,Friction adds time gap,Different masses cause different effects,One acts first,C,They feel unequal because of different resulting accelerations.
Which pair occurs at the same instant?,Accelerating and braking,Falling and landing,Pushing on a door and it pushing back,Throwing and grabbing,C,Push–push pairs happen instantly.
Car hits wall with 5000 N. Wall exerts force:,More if heavy,5000 N instantly,Less after a delay,500 N later,B,The wall responds immediately with an equal and opposite force.
You pull on 4 kg block with 20 N. Force from block on you?,10 N later,30 N eventually,20 N back immediately,Zero until motion starts,C,The block exerts equal force at the same moment.
Two magnets repel with 12 N. Forces act:,Simultaneously with equal magnitude,Only after motion,Randomly,Stronger on bigger magnet,A,Each magnet pushes with 12 N in opposite directions at the same instant.
