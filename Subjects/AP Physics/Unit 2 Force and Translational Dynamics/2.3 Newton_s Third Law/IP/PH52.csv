Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"According to Newton’s third law, forces in a pair act on:",The object with greater mass,Just one object,Different objects,The same object,C,Action–reaction forces always act on separate objects.
You push a box. Where does the box’s reaction force act?,On the box itself,Nowhere,On you,On the floor,C,The box pushes back on you — not on itself.
What is the action–reaction pair when a ball hits a wall?,"Ball accelerates, then reacts","Ball pushes wall, wall pushes ball","Ball hits wall, wall moves","Ball touches wall, wall gains mass",B,Each force acts on the other object — not on the same one.
Friction force from the ground on a shoe is paired with:,Air resistance,Weight of shoe,Force of shoe on the ground,Normal force,C,Force pair exists between ground and foot.
A book sits on a table. What is the pair to gravity on book?,Earth pushes table,Table pushes book,Book pulls up on Earth,Book pushes air,C,Weight force is paired with equal and opposite pull from the book on Earth.
Why can’t action and reaction cancel each other?,They happen too fast,They are internal forces,They cancel only with motion,They act on different objects,D,Each force in the pair acts on a different object — so they don’t cancel.
Which interaction illustrates Newton’s third law correctly?,"Foot pushes ground, ground pushes foot","Ball hits wall, wall accelerates",Car speeds up then slows,"Box pushes table, table moves",A,Each force is between two objects — not on the same object.
"If you push a crate with 60 N, what is the crate’s force on you?",30 N on crate,0 N,It depends on mass,60 N back on you,D,The crate applies 60 N back on you — equal and opposite.
Skater A pushes skater B with 40 N. What is force on skater A?,20 N from A,None,40 N from B,80 N total,C,Equal and opposite forces — A feels 40 N from B.
Block sits on table. Normal = 50 N. What is reaction force?,Weight of block,Gravity on table,Block pushing down on table (50 N),Friction on block,C,Normal from table matches block pushing downward.
