Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"According to Newton’s third law, what is true of forces in interactions?",The larger object pushes harder,Heavier object wins,They are equal and opposite,Only contact forces obey it,C,"Every force comes with an equal and opposite reaction, regardless of object mass."
"In a collision between a truck and a car, force on each is:",None on truck,Equal in magnitude,Greater on the truck,Greater on the car,B,Forces are equal and opposite — truck and car push on each other equally.
Why does the smaller object accelerate more?,It hits first,It has friction,It receives more force,It has less mass with the same force,D,Same force → smaller mass means greater acceleration (F = ma).
A person and a wall push on each other. Who exerts more force?,They exert equal forces,Neither,The wall,The person,A,Force pair is equal regardless of which moves.
Two skaters of different mass push off each other. What’s true?,Total energy is equal,Unequal forces,Only big one moves,"Equal force, unequal acceleration",D,Equal forces → different accelerations due to different mass.
Which best reflects Newton’s third law?,Faster object applies more force,Forces come in pairs,Larger objects win,Action cancels reaction,B,Every force has an equal and opposite force acting on the other object.
"If Earth pulls on you with 600 N, what is your force on Earth?",0 N,It depends on mass,9.8 N,600 N upward,D,The two forces are equal and opposite — you pull Earth with 600 N upward.
Truck = 1000 kg. Car = 500 kg. They collide. Force on car = 8000 N. Force on truck?,16000 N,4000 N,2000 N,8000 N,D,Newton’s third law → equal and opposite forces.
Two skaters push off: 50 kg and 100 kg. Both apply 300 N. Acceleration of 50 kg skater?,3 m/s²,0 m/s²,6 m/s²,2 m/s²,C,a = F/m = 300 / 50 = 6 m/s².
Earth pulls on a 10 kg object with 98 N. Force from object on Earth?,98 N,9.8 N,10 N,0 N,A,Equal and opposite — object pulls up on Earth with 98 N.
