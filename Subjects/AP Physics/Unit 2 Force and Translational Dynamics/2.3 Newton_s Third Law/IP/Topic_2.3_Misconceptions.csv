Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH50,Bigger objects exert bigger forces,"Thinks that in an interaction, the more massive object always exerts a larger force, misunderstanding Newton’s third law of equal and opposite forces."
PH51,Action and reaction happen at different times,"Believes one object acts first and the other reacts later, failing to understand that action-reaction forces occur simultaneously."
PH52,Action and reaction act on the same object,Incorrectly pairs forces that act on the same object instead of identifying forces acting between two different interacting objects.
PH53,Only moving objects exert forces,"Assumes that only moving or accelerating objects can exert forces, ignoring that stationary objects can exert equal and opposite interaction forces."
PH54,"If one object accelerates more, it feels more force","Fails to recognize that different accelerations result from different masses, not unequal forces, when Newton’s third law forces are equal in magnitude."
PH55,Forces are not real if nothing moves,"Assumes that if an object doesn’t move, no force is present, ignoring equilibrium and the presence of balanced forces."
PH56,Tension is always the same in all situations,"Does not recognize that tension may vary in different parts of a system unless the string is ideal (massless, no friction)."
