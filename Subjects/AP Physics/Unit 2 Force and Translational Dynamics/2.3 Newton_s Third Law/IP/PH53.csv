Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can stationary objects exert forces?,Only if they’re large,"Yes, through interaction","No, only moving objects do",Only in frictionless environments,B,"Forces arise from interactions, not motion — a wall can exert a force."
Why does a table exert an upward normal force?,It feels gravity,It is accelerating upward,It interacts with the object resting on it,It pushes against the floor,C,Stationary surfaces apply contact forces when other objects rest on them.
What does Newton’s third law say about a person leaning on a wall?,The wall must move,Only the person pushes,Force doesn’t exist,The wall pushes back equally,D,Even stationary objects exert equal and opposite forces in response to interaction.
Which of these exerts a force while remaining still?,A ball in freefall,A rope under tension,An object on ice,An arrow in flight,B,Stationary rope can exert a tension force.
What force does the ground apply to a standing person?,Tension,Normal force,Weight,Friction,B,The ground pushes up with a normal force to support the person’s weight.
What’s true about forces from static objects?,They occur when there’s interaction,They only appear when falling,They’re invisible,They don’t exist,A,Forces are real even if there’s no motion — interaction is key.
Why can a still person exert force?,They fall immediately,They don’t push anything,They are accelerating,Their feet press on the ground,D,"The force comes from contact with the ground, not motion."
Block sits on floor. m = 10 kg. What is the normal force?,98 N up,9.8 N,0 N,10 N,A,Normal = weight = m·g = 10 × 9.8 = 98 N upward.
You lean on wall with 150 N. What is wall’s force?,0 N,150 N back,75 N,300 N,B,Wall pushes back with equal force (Newton’s third law).
A spring is stretched and not moving. What’s force it exerts?,Only downward,Equal to force pulling it,Only with acceleration,Zero,B,Static equilibrium means equal and opposite forces exist even if object is still.
