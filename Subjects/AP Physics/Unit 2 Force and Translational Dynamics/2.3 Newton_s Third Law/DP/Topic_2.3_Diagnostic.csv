Two skaters push off each other. What happens?,A,They move in opposite directions with equal forces.,True,,The heavier skater pushes harder.,False,PH50,Only one skater accelerates.,False,PH54,The lighter skater moves backward.,False,PH50,Newton’s third law: equal and opposite forces regardless of mass.
A truck collides with a small car. Which force is greater?,C,Truck on car.,False,PH50,Car on truck.,False,PH50,They are equal in magnitude.,True,,Whichever has more speed.,False,PH54,Interaction forces are equal and opposite.
Why does a smaller mass accelerate more in a collision?,B,It feels more force.,False,PH50,It has the same force but less mass (a = F/m).,True,,It pushes harder.,False,PH54,Newton’s third law doesn’t apply here.,False,PH51,Equal force + smaller mass → larger acceleration.
Which of the following is a correct action–reaction pair?,D,Weight and normal force.,False,PH55,Friction and tension.,False,PH55,Normal force and acceleration.,False,PH55,Earth pulls down on object— object pulls up on Earth.,True,,Both gravitational — equal and opposite forces on different objects.
Why can’t third-law forces cancel out?,A,Because they act on different objects.,True,,Because they are imaginary.,False,PH52,Because their direction varies.,False,PH50,Because the object is at rest.,False,PH55,Action-reaction pairs act on separate objects — they never cancel directly.
A student says a wall doesn’t push back when you push it. What’s wrong?,C,Walls only apply friction.,False,PH50,Normal force is the only upward force.,False,PH52,The wall applies equal force back.,True,,Force depends on strength.,False,PH54,Walls push back with equal force — you just can’t feel motion if you don’t accelerate.
A rocket fires its engines downward. Why does it rise?,D,Because its mass decreases.,False,PH54,Because friction pulls it up.,False,PH55,Because air lifts it.,False,PH51,Because the exhaust pushes down and the rocket reacts upward.,True,,Rocket and exhaust are action-reaction pair.
A block on a table exerts force on the table. Where is this shown?,A,It is the reaction force to the normal force.,True,,It cancels gravity.,False,PH55,It is not measurable.,False,PH51,It reverses direction.,False,PH50,Block pushes on table just as table pushes up on block — third-law pair.
Which forces cancel on a single object in equilibrium?,C,Normal and weight — third-law pair.,False,PH55,Tension and gravity — third-law pair.,False,PH55,Forces acting on the object from different sources.,True,,Action-reaction forces cancel each other.,False,PH52,Only forces acting on same object can cancel.
A person jumps. What is the reaction to pushing down on the ground?,B,Their acceleration.,False,PH51,Ground pushing up with equal force.,True,,Gravity pulling down.,False,PH55,Their weight.,False,PH55,Push down → ground pushes back up — third-law reaction.
