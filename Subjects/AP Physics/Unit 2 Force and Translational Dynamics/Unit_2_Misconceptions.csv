Code,Misconception,Explanation,Misconception Title,Misconception Description
PH36,The system is just one object,Thinks a 'system' must be a single object rather than a group of interacting objects modeled together.,,
PH37,System behavior is the same as any part,"Assumes every part of a system behaves identically to the whole, ignoring internal variation or interactions.",,
PH38,Center of mass is always inside an object,Does not realize that the center of mass can lie outside the physical material of an object or system.,,
PH39,All systems must have a visible center,Thinks systems without symmetry cannot have a center of mass or that it must be marked physically.,,
PH40,Changing one object changes the system,Fails to recognize that only external forces or interactions can alter a system’s momentum or motion as a whole.,,
PH41,System properties don’t depend on parts,"Ignores that the total mass, position, and behavior of a system are derived from its components.",,
PH42,Internal forces can change system motion,"Believes that forces between parts of a system (e.g., pushing or pulling) can change its center-of-mass motion.",,
PH43,Forces can act on an object without interaction,Does not understand that all forces arise from interactions between two objects or systems — no object can exert a net force on itself.,,
PH44,"Forces come from motion, not interaction","Thinks moving objects generate force by moving, ignoring the requirement of an interaction with another object or system.",,
PH45,Free-body diagrams include forces the object exerts,Incorrectly includes forces exerted *by* the object rather than only those exerted *on* the object in a free-body diagram.,,
PH46,All forces are contact forces,"Overlooks non-contact forces like gravity, thinking only visible touching causes forces.",,
PH47,Direction of force must match motion,"Thinks force always points in the same direction as the object’s velocity, ignoring that force can oppose or redirect motion.",,
PH48,Center of mass has no role in diagrams,Does not understand that forces should be drawn from the object's center of mass in free-body diagrams.,,
PH49,Force components must be shown on FBDs,"Draws components (e.g., Fᵧ, Fₓ) on free-body diagrams even though AP only requires full forces, not their trigonometric parts.",,
PH50,Bigger objects exert bigger forces,"Thinks that in an interaction, the more massive object always exerts a larger force, misunderstanding Newton’s third law of equal and opposite forces.",,
PH51,Action and reaction happen at different times,"Believes one object acts first and the other reacts later, failing to understand that action-reaction forces occur simultaneously.",,
PH52,Action and reaction act on the same object,Incorrectly pairs forces that act on the same object instead of identifying forces acting between two different interacting objects.,,
PH53,Only moving objects exert forces,"Assumes that only moving or accelerating objects can exert forces, ignoring that stationary objects can exert equal and opposite interaction forces.",,
PH54,"If one object accelerates more, it feels more force","Fails to recognize that different accelerations result from different masses, not unequal forces, when Newton’s third law forces are equal in magnitude.",,
PH55,Forces are not real if nothing moves,"Assumes that if an object doesn’t move, no force is present, ignoring equilibrium and the presence of balanced forces.",,
PH56,Tension is always the same in all situations,"Does not recognize that tension may vary in different parts of a system unless the string is ideal (massless, no friction).",,
PH57,Objects in equilibrium have no forces on them,"Believes that if an object isn’t accelerating, no forces are acting on it — missing that forces can be balanced (net force = 0).",,
PH58,Motion requires a net force,"Assumes that constant motion must be caused by a continuing force, misunderstanding Newton’s first law.",,
PH59,"If an object is moving, it must be accelerating","Equates motion with acceleration, failing to distinguish between constant velocity and changing velocity.",,
PH60,Balanced forces cause objects to stop,"Thinks that if forces are balanced, objects must be at rest, rather than possibly moving at constant velocity.",,
PH61,Inertia is a force,"Misinterprets inertia as a physical force that pushes back, rather than as a property of mass resisting acceleration.",,
PH62,"Forces cancel if they act in opposite directions, even on different objects","Confuses Newton’s third law pairs with internal balancing, thinking forces on different objects can cancel each other.",,
PH63,Objects naturally come to rest without a force,"Assumes stopping is natural unless something keeps pushing, missing the idea of inertia and neglecting friction.",,
PH64,,,Net force means motion,"Believes that if there is a net force on an object, it must be moving (not just accelerating)."
PH65,,,No motion means no force,"Assumes that stationary objects have no forces acting on them, ignoring the possibility of balanced forces."
PH66,,,Heavier objects accelerate more,Believes that greater mass leads to greater acceleration under the same net force.
PH67,,,Mass causes force,"Confuses mass with force, treating mass as something that directly “pushes” rather than resists acceleration."
PH68,,,Constant force means constant velocity,"Fails to recognize that constant net force causes constant acceleration, not constant velocity."
PH69,,,Net force is always in the direction of motion,"Assumes force must be in the same direction as the object’s motion, even during slowing or turning."
PH70,,,All forces on an object add algebraically without direction,"Ignores vector nature of force, simply adds or subtracts magnitudes regardless of direction."
PH78,Friction always opposes motion,"Assumes friction only resists movement rather than understanding that static friction can also enable motion (e.g., walking or rolling).",,
PH79,Kinetic friction is stronger than static friction,Confuses the general rule; doesn't realize that static friction has a higher maximum value than kinetic friction.,,
PH80,Friction depends on surface area,"Believes that a larger contact area increases friction, ignoring that friction depends on the normal force and material properties, not area.",,
PH81,Normal force always equals weight,"Incorrectly assumes normal force must always balance weight, even on ramps or in elevators.",,
PH82,Friction is constant regardless of force,Overlooks that static friction adjusts up to a maximum value based on applied force before motion starts.,,
PH83,Friction is the same for all directions,"Fails to account for directional dependence and surface orientation (e.g., uphill vs. downhill frictional effects).",,
PH84,Friction is a separate force from the surface,"Treats friction as external or independent from the interacting surfaces, rather than arising from microscopic interactions between them.",,
PH85,Springs always exert upward force,"Assumes springs always push up, not recognizing they can pull or push depending on how they're stretched or compressed.",,
PH86,Springs exert constant force,"Thinks spring force is constant regardless of stretch, ignoring that force depends on displacement from equilibrium (Hooke’s Law).",,
PH87,Spring force depends on mass,Believes that heavier objects result in stronger springs regardless of how much the spring is stretched.,,
PH88,The relaxed length is arbitrary,Does not understand that spring force depends on how far the spring is stretched from its natural (relaxed) length.,,
PH89,Compressed springs store no energy,"Thinks springs must be stretched to do work or store energy, not realizing compression also stores potential energy.",,
PH90,The spring force is always vertical,"Assumes spring force acts only up/down like gravity, ignoring that it acts along the axis of the spring.",,
PH91,The direction of spring force is the same as motion,"Mistakes the direction of spring force as always aligned with motion, rather than toward the equilibrium position.",,
PH92,Objects in circular motion have outward force,"Believes in a 'centrifugal force' pushing outward, rather than recognizing centripetal force as the inward force maintaining circular motion.",,
PH93,Velocity and acceleration point in same direction,"Fails to recognize that in uniform circular motion, velocity is tangent to the path while acceleration is directed inward.",,
PH94,Faster speed means greater outward force,"Thinks an outward force increases with speed, confusing reaction feeling (inertia) with actual inward centripetal force.",,
PH95,Centripetal force is a new kind of force,"Treats centripetal force as a standalone force rather than the net inward force provided by gravity, tension, or friction.",,
PH96,Acceleration means changing speed only,Does not understand that changing direction (even at constant speed) constitutes acceleration in circular motion.,,
PH97,Object continues circular path if force is removed,"Thinks that removing centripetal force would keep the object moving in a circle, instead of moving in a straight tangent line.",,
PH98,Tangential and centripetal acceleration are the same,"Confuses acceleration toward the center with changes in speed, not recognizing they are distinct components.",,
