Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does surface area affect the amount of friction between two objects?,Only for rolling motion,"No, friction depends on the normal force and the coefficient of friction",Only when objects are flat,"Yes, more area always means more friction",B,"Friction is calculated as f = μ·N, which does not depend on contact area for typical rigid surfaces."
Which factors determine the amount of friction?,Mass and volume,Surface area and color,Speed and distance,Normal force and coefficient of friction,D,Friction = μ·N — independent of surface area under most conditions.
"If the area of contact doubles, what happens to friction (with same weight and material)?",It becomes zero,It doubles,It stays the same,It halves,C,Friction is not dependent on area — only normal force and μ.
Why does a wide tire not produce more friction than a narrow one with the same weight?,Because of rolling resistance,Because it reduces drag,Because area does not affect friction for rigid objects,Because it spreads the force evenly,C,"With equal normal force and surface, area doesn’t affect sliding friction."
What best explains the effect of contact area on friction for rigid bodies?,Smaller area increases pressure,Area does not affect friction,Only roughness matters,More area means more sticking,B,Rigid objects on a surface experience the same friction regardless of contact area.
Which of the following statements is false?,Friction depends on material,Friction depends on normal force,Friction increases with contact area,Friction is independent of velocity (for dry surfaces),C,Area does not appear in the standard equation for friction.
Why is it a mistake to say that larger objects experience more friction because of area?,"Because friction depends on force pressing down, not area",Because gravity is weaker,Because air pressure pushes back,Because heavier things are faster,A,Friction is determined by the weight pressing the object into the surface and surface material.
"μ = 0.4, normal force = 200 N. What is friction force?",400 N,0.4 N,200 N,80 N,D,f = μ·N = 0.4 × 200 = 80 N.
Same mass object slides with small and large surface areas. What happens to friction?,It remains constant,It increases with area,It disappears,It depends on direction,A,Friction remains unchanged if weight and surface are the same.
μ = 0.5. Object weight = 100 N. What is fₘₐₓ?,100 N,5 N,50 N,500 N,C,f = μ·N = 0.5 × 100 = 50 N.
