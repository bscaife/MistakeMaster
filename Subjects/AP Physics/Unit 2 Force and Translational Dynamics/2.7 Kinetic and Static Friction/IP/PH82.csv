Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does static friction remain constant as force increases?,"Yes, it stays fixed",Only when objects are moving,"No, it adjusts up to a maximum value based on applied force",Only for light objects,C,Static friction increases in response to applied force until reaching fₛ₍ₘₐₓ₎ = μₛ·N.
What happens to static friction when a small force is applied?,It instantly becomes kinetic,It stays zero,It exceeds the applied force,It matches the applied force up to a maximum limit,D,Static friction resists motion by adjusting to match applied force until it can no longer hold.
What does the term 'maximum static friction' mean?,The friction in space,The heaviest friction,The most friction before the object begins to slide,The weight of an object,C,Maximum static friction (fₛ₍ₘₐₓ₎) is the greatest friction that can be applied before motion starts.
Why does a heavy box stay still even with a small push?,It has too much mass to move,Gravity cancels out friction,Air holds it still,Static friction adjusts to resist small applied forces,D,Static friction scales up until reaching its maximum.
When is static friction no longer able to resist motion?,When applied force exceeds its maximum value,When normal force increases,Only with rolling objects,When speed is high,A,"As soon as applied force > fₛ₍ₘₐₓ₎, motion begins and kinetic friction takes over."
What is true about friction as an object is pushed harder before it moves?,Kinetic friction begins,Friction stays constant,Static friction increases with the applied force up to a maximum,Friction disappears,C,Static friction adapts to match increasing applied force until it breaks.
Which type of friction has a variable value before motion starts?,Fluid friction,Static friction,Rolling friction,Kinetic friction,B,Static friction ranges from 0 to fₛ₍ₘₐₓ₎ depending on how hard the object is pushed.
"μₛ = 0.5, N = 100 N. What is max static friction?",50 N,100 N,0.5 N,200 N,A,fₛ₍ₘₐₓ₎ = μₛ·N = 0.5 × 100 = 50 N.
"An applied force of 20 N is exerted, and fₛ₍ₘₐₓ₎ = 40 N. What is static friction?",40 N,20 N,60 N,0 N,B,Static friction matches the applied force if it's under fₛ₍ₘₐₓ₎.
"If the applied force increases from 10 N to 40 N (below fₛ₍ₘₐₓ₎ = 50 N), what happens to friction?",It stays at 10 N,It disappears,It drops,It increases with it,D,"Static friction increases as needed, up to its maximum."
