Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does friction act the same way in every direction?,Only if the slope is vertical,Only if the object is heavy,"Yes, it is always equal","No, friction depends on motion direction and orientation of the surface",D,Friction always opposes relative motion between surfaces — its direction depends on how the object tries to move.
What is the direction of friction for a block sliding uphill?,Upward,Uphill,Zero,Downhill,D,"Friction acts opposite the direction of motion, so it points downhill as the block slides up."
What is the direction of static friction for a car driving uphill without slipping?,Toward the center,Downhill,Normal to the surface,Uphill,D,Friction enables uphill motion in rolling — it acts in the same direction as intended motion.
How does friction change when pushing an object left versus right?,It vanishes if pushed left,It reverses force,It always opposes the direction of motion,It depends on mass,C,Friction changes direction to oppose applied motion — not constant across directions.
"If an object rests on an incline without sliding, where does static friction act?",There is no friction,Perpendicular to surface,Down the incline,Up the incline,D,Friction opposes the component of gravity down the ramp — so it acts uphill.
What determines the direction of friction?,Relative motion or intended motion,Speed,Shape,Mass,A,Friction opposes slipping — so its direction depends on which way the object tries to move.
"When a box is pulled at an angle, how does friction behave?",It reverses,It points upward,It still opposes the horizontal component of motion,It adds to normal force,C,Only the component of applied force along the surface matters for friction.
"μₖ = 0.2, N = 100 N. What is kinetic friction force?",0.2 N,10 N,20 N,200 N,C,"fₖ = μₖ·N = 0.2 × 100 = 20 N — direction depends on motion, not constant."
A box slides down a ramp. In which direction is friction?,Up the ramp,Perpendicular to ramp,Down the ramp,None,A,Friction resists sliding — so it acts up the ramp as the box slides down.
An object is rolling up a hill without slipping. What is static friction direction?,None,Uphill,Perpendicular to slope,Downhill,B,"Friction allows rolling — in this case, it supports uphill motion."
