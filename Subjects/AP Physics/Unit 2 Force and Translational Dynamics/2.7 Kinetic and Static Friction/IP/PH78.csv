Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does friction always act opposite to motion?,"No, friction can also act in the direction of intended motion (e.g., walking)",Only when sliding,"Yes, it always resists",Only in air,A,"Static friction can enable motion by preventing slipping, as in walking or rolling."
What kind of friction enables a person to walk forward?,Air resistance pushing,Kinetic friction opposing motion,Normal force increasing,Static friction acting forward,D,"Static friction pushes forward against the foot, propelling you forward."
"When a wheel rolls without slipping, what direction is static friction?",It can act forward to enable rolling,It opposes motion,It acts upward,It cancels gravity,A,Static friction at the point of contact often acts in the direction of motion for rolling objects.
Why is static friction not always opposite motion?,Because it can prevent slipping and help push objects forward,Because it floats,Because it vanishes in air,Because it reverses,A,Friction helps initiate and sustain intended motion in many scenarios.
Which situation involves friction aiding motion?,A block sliding to a stop,An object falling,A person walking,A balloon rising,C,Walking involves static friction pushing you forward off the ground.
What is true of kinetic friction?,It acts upward,It acts opposite direction of motion,It acts only in liquids,It helps motion,B,Kinetic friction opposes sliding motion.
"If friction acts forward on a tire, what does that indicate?",There’s no friction,The car is skidding,The tire is rolling without slipping,The car is falling,C,Static friction on rolling tires enables forward motion.
A person walks with static friction = 150 N. What direction is this force?,Zero,Forward,Backward,Upward,B,Friction pushes forward to allow walking.
Box slides at constant speed. Friction = 20 N. Applied force?,20 N,40 N,10 N,0,A,Constant speed = forces are balanced → applied = friction = 20 N.
Tire rolls forward. What direction is static friction?,None,Forward,Backward,Downward,B,Static friction acts in the direction that prevents slipping — typically forward.
