Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH78,Friction always opposes motion,"Assumes friction only resists movement rather than understanding that static friction can also enable motion (e.g., walking or rolling)."
PH79,Kinetic friction is stronger than static friction,Confuses the general rule; doesn't realize that static friction has a higher maximum value than kinetic friction.
PH80,Friction depends on surface area,"Believes that a larger contact area increases friction, ignoring that friction depends on the normal force and material properties, not area."
PH81,Normal force always equals weight,"Incorrectly assumes normal force must always balance weight, even on ramps or in elevators."
PH82,Friction is constant regardless of force,Overlooks that static friction adjusts up to a maximum value based on applied force before motion starts.
PH83,Friction is the same for all directions,"Fails to account for directional dependence and surface orientation (e.g., uphill vs. downhill frictional effects)."
PH84,Friction is a separate force from the surface,"Treats friction as external or independent from the interacting surfaces, rather than arising from microscopic interactions between them."
