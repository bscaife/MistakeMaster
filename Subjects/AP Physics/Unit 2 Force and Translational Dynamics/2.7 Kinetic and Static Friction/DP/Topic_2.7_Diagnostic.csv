A 10 kg block rests on a surface with μₛ = 0.4. What is the maximum static friction force?,D,4 N,FALSE,PH79,40 kg,FALSE,PH78,0.4 N,FALSE,PH80,39.2 N,TRUE,,Static friction max: fₛ₍max₎ = μₛ·N = μₛ·m·g
A box is pulled with 50 N— friction resists with 20 N. What is net force?,B,70 N,FALSE,PH82,30 N,TRUE,,0 N,FALSE,PH79,Depends on surface area.,FALSE,PH80,Net force = F_applied − f_friction = 50 − 20 = 30 N.
Kinetic friction acts—,C,Only when acceleration is negative.,FALSE,PH83,Before motion begins.,FALSE,PH78,During sliding— opposite direction of velocity.,TRUE,,Only when normal force is zero.,FALSE,PH83,Kinetic friction opposes relative motion while sliding.
Static friction equals what when object is just about to move?,A,fₛ = μₛ·N,TRUE,,fₛ = μₖ·N,FALSE,PH79,fₛ = 0,FALSE,PH78,fₛ = m·g,FALSE,PH80,At threshold of motion: fₛ₍max₎ = μₛ·N
What causes higher friction: heavier mass or larger surface area?,B,Larger area.,FALSE,PH80,Greater normal force due to heavier mass.,TRUE,,Shape of the object.,FALSE,PH84,Higher acceleration.,FALSE,PH79,Friction f = μ·N → more mass → more N → more f
A block is pulled at angle θ above horizontal. What effect does θ have on normal force?,C,It increases normal force.,FALSE,PH83,It has no effect.,FALSE,PH83,It reduces normal force: N = mg − F·sin(θ),TRUE,,It increases friction always.,FALSE,PH83,Vertical component of applied force reduces N → lowers friction.
An object slides at constant velocity. What can be said about kinetic friction?,D,It equals zero.,FALSE,PH79,It exceeds applied force.,FALSE,PH82,It causes acceleration.,FALSE,PH78,It equals applied force in magnitude.,TRUE,,Constant velocity → net force = 0 → fₖ = F_applied
Which expression gives acceleration of block pulled with force F against kinetic friction μₖ·m·g?,B,a = μₖ·g,FALSE,PH79,a = (F − μₖ·m·g) / m,TRUE,,a = F / μₖ·g,FALSE,PH80,a = F · m / g,FALSE,PH64,Net force = F − fₖ = F − μₖ·m·g → a = (F − μₖ·m·g)/m
If pulling angle increases— what happens to friction force?,C,It increases.,FALSE,PH83,It remains constant.,FALSE,PH83,It decreases as vertical force component reduces N.,TRUE,,It depends on surface area.,FALSE,PH80,Larger θ → more vertical lift → less normal force → less friction
An object sits on ramp angle θ. What is the static friction condition?,A,fₛ = m·g·sin(θ) when balanced,TRUE,,fₛ = μₛ·m·g·sin(θ),FALSE,PH83,fₛ = μₖ·m·g·cos(θ),FALSE,PH79,fₛ = m / g,FALSE,PH80,Static friction balances downslope component: fₛ = m·g·sin(θ)
