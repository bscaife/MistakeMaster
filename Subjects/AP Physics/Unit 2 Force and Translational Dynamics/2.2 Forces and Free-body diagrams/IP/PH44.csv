Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is necessary for a force to exist?,An interaction between objects,An object moving fast,High mass,Large area,A,"Forces come from interactions, not just motion."
Does motion alone cause force?,No,Only at high speed,Yes,Only in gravity,A,Motion doesn’t cause a force unless it involves interaction with something.
Which statement is true about force?,"It requires interaction, not just movement",It appears from acceleration,Only friction creates it,It increases with speed,A,"Forces arise from interaction, not motion alone."
A spacecraft coasts through space. Why is there no net force?,Gravity is off,It’s isolated,No interaction is present,Speed is low,C,No force exists if the object is not interacting with anything.
Which of the following causes a force?,One object moving fast,Anything accelerating,Two objects pushing on each other,A light object,C,Force comes from interaction — contact or field.
What causes the normal force?,Friction,Surface interaction,Weight of object,Motion alone,B,Normal force arises from physical contact with a surface.
Why is a car coasting not exerting a force?,It isn’t interacting with anything,Its tires are circular,Its engine is off,Its friction is large,A,"Force requires push/pull from another object, not just movement."
2 kg block falls under gravity. What’s force on it?,2 N,9.8 N,19.6 N,0 N,C,F = m·g = 2 × 9.8 = 19.6 N from gravity’s interaction.
Object moves 4 m/s without touching anything. What is net force?,4 N,9.8 N,0 N,Depends on speed,C,No interaction → no net force.
Skater gliding on ice at constant speed. What’s net force?,9.8 N,10 N,Equal to speed,0 N,D,Constant velocity = no net force; no interaction = no applied force.
