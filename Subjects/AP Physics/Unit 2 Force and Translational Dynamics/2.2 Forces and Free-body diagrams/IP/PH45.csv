Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does a free-body diagram show?,Forces caused *by* the object,Forces acting *on* the object,Only net force,All motion,B,Free-body diagrams isolate and show only external forces acting *on* the object.
Should forces an object exerts on others be in its FBD?,Sometimes,Only during collisions,No,Yes,C,Only forces acting *on* the object appear in its diagram.
A person pushes a box. Which force appears in the box’s FBD?,Friction on the person,The box pushing back,Gravity from the person,The push from the person,D,Only forces *on* the box belong in the FBD.
The box pushes on the ground. Include that in the box’s FBD?,"No, it’s a force *by* the box","Yes, all forces count",Only when accelerating,Only if heavy,A,Forces the object exerts are not included in its own FBD.
Which diagram correctly represents forces on a book on a table?,Weight and reaction force,Gravity and normal force,Push and pull arrows,Net force only,B,"Gravity pulls down, table pushes up — both act *on* the book."
"For a block sliding on a ramp, which forces belong in its FBD?",Force block exerts on ramp,Center of mass location,"Gravity, normal, friction",Ramp’s mass,C,All external forces acting *on* the block should be shown.
Which forces are *not* part of a block’s FBD?,Gravity on the block,Friction resisting motion,Normal force upward,Forces the block applies,D,Forces *by* the block are not shown in its own FBD.
Block on ramp: 5 kg. What force does Earth exert on it?,9.8 N,25 N,0 N,49 N,D,Weight = m·g = 5 × 9.8 = 49 N downward.
"In FBD of hanging mass, how many forces?",0,1 — gravity only,3 — add friction,2 — tension up and gravity down,D,Tension pulls up; gravity pulls down — both act on the object.
Box slides right. Friction force in FBD?,Rightward,Leftward,Upward,None,B,Friction always opposes direction of motion.
