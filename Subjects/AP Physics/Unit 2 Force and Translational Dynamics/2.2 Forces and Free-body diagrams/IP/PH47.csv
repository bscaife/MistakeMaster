Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can a force act opposite to motion?,"Yes, it causes slowing down",Only if frictionless,"No, force always drives motion",Only if at rest,A,A force opposite to velocity slows the object (deceleration).
Which of these shows force opposite to velocity?,Freefall,Horizontal throw,Braking car,Car speeding up,C,Brakes apply a force in the opposite direction of motion.
What happens when velocity and force point in different directions?,Object slows down or changes direction,Motion becomes circular,Force is zero,Object speeds up,A,"When force and velocity oppose, motion slows or turns."
"If force = 0, but object moves, what happens?",Object continues at constant velocity,Object stops,Object turns around,Object accelerates,A,Motion continues if no force acts (Newton’s first law).
Can a force change direction without changing speed?,Only with friction,Only at rest,"No, speed must change","Yes, in circular motion",D,A perpendicular force redirects motion — like centripetal force.
Which scenario shows force not matching direction of motion?,A satellite coasting,A ball falling,An object in freefall,Friction slowing a sliding box,D,Friction acts opposite motion.
Why can direction of force differ from direction of velocity?,Because mass is high,Only if slowing down,Only when speed is zero,Because force changes velocity (accelerates),D,Force changes velocity’s direction or magnitude — not always aligned.
Object moves at 6 m/s right. Friction = 2 N left. What happens?,Object reverses,Object gains mass,Object speeds up,Object slows down,D,Force is opposite velocity → deceleration.
"Ball at peak of motion: vᵧ = 0, aᵧ = −9.8 m/s². What does force do?",Force is zero,Force matches velocity,Force changes velocity direction,Ball floats,C,Force acts downward even when velocity is momentarily zero.
Car moves left. Brakes apply force right. Result?,No effect,Slows down,Speeds up,Reverses,B,Force opposite motion causes deceleration.
