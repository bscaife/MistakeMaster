Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What causes all forces in Newtonian physics?,Interactions between objects,Mass alone,Motion of a single object,Speed only,A,Forces arise only from interactions between at least two systems.
Can an object exert a net force on itself?,No,Only if it's accelerating,Only in space,Yes,A,An object cannot push or pull itself without interaction with another object.
Which best illustrates Newton’s third law?,"You push a wall, and the wall pushes back",A car speeds up,Mass increases,A rock falls,A,All forces involve equal and opposite pairs — no force exists in isolation.
What is the reaction force to gravity pulling on a book?,Friction,There is none,The table pushing up,The book pulling up on Earth,D,"Gravity is mutual — the Earth pulls on the book, and the book pulls on Earth."
Which statement is true about forces?,They exist only with speed,They always involve two objects,They can arise without contact,One object can force itself,B,"Forces always describe an interaction, even when contact is not involved (e.g., gravity)."
Is it possible to have a net force without an external source?,Only in zero gravity,Only with heat,"Yes, by moving fast","No, all net forces come from interactions",D,Force requires external interaction with another object or field.
Why can't you 'push yourself' in space?,Because air pushes back,Because of mass,Because no external object is involved,Because of gravity,C,"Without interacting with something else, you cannot apply a force to yourself."
Block mass = 2 kg. Gravity force on it = ?,19.6 N,4.9 N,2 N,9.8 N,A,"F = m·g = 2 × 9.8 = 19.6 N. Earth pulls the block, and the block pulls back on Earth."
You push a 5 kg crate with 10 N. Reaction force?,Normal force acts sideways,Crate pushes you with 10 N,Crate pulls Earth,Crate exerts 5 N,B,Force pairs are equal and opposite: crate pushes back on you.
Force between two objects is 20 N. What is the force on each?,Zero,They cancel out completely,"20 N, opposite directions",One gets 40 N,C,"For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction — 20 N each, opposite directions."
