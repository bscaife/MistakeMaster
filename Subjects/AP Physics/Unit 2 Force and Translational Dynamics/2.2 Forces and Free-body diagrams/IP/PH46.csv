Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which of these is a non-contact force?,Normal force,Tension,Gravitational force,Friction,C,Gravity acts without direct contact — it’s a field force.
Can a force act without touching?,Only in air,Only on large objects,"No, contact is required","Yes, via fields like gravity",D,"Field forces like gravity, electricity, and magnetism do not require contact."
Which pair involves contact force?,Magnet repelling metal,Earth and Moon,Falling apple and Earth,Foot pushing ground,D,Only the first involves physical contact; the rest are field interactions.
Gravity is considered a force because:,It touches all objects,It’s electromagnetic,It creates acceleration without touching,It only acts when falling,C,Gravity acts at a distance by generating acceleration.
Which is NOT a contact force?,Tension,Magnetic force,Normal force,Friction,B,Magnetic forces operate across a distance.
"If object is falling, what force is acting?",Tension,Gravity (non-contact),Normal,Friction,B,"In freefall, the force is gravity — no contact needed."
Contact forces require:,Large mass,Vacuum,Charge,Physical interaction between surfaces,D,Contact forces arise from touching surfaces or connections like tension.
5 kg object falls. What non-contact force acts on it?,5 N,49 N (gravity),0 N,98 N,B,F = m·g = 5·9.8 = 49 N.
Which force acts between Earth and Moon?,Tension,Gravity,Normal,Friction,B,Gravitational attraction acts across space without contact.
2 C charge feels repulsion 4 m away. Contact needed?,Yes,No,Only if metal,Only in water,B,Electric field acts without contact.
