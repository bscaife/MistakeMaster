Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Where should forces typically be drawn from in a free-body diagram?,The outer edge,Any random point,The center of mass,Each contact point,C,"For simplification, forces are usually drawn as if acting on the center of mass."
Why do we draw net forces at the COM?,It removes mass,It simplifies analysis of motion,It centers torque,It visualizes charge,B,Using COM allows easy application of Newton’s laws.
Which point determines an object’s motion under net force?,Surface,Center of mass,Geometric center,Point of contact,B,Net force determines acceleration of the COM of the system.
"If multiple forces act on a rigid object, where do we assume they act?",At friction site,At COM for linear motion,At massless point,At outermost edge,B,"For translational analysis, we treat forces as acting at the COM."
Does COM move under net force?,"No, only parts move","Yes, it accelerates",Only if object is large,Only if COM is visible,B,F = m·a applies to the motion of the COM.
A falling object rotates. What does COM do?,Spins in place,Follows a parabolic path,Stays stationary,Falls straight down,B,"Regardless of spin, the COM follows a projectile path."
"When drawing gravity, where is it placed in a diagram?",At the COM,Spread over surface,At the bottom edge,Near the left corner,A,Weight is modeled as acting from the center of mass.
Block mass = 5 kg. Gravity force acts at?,Base,Top,COM,Edge,C,Weight is modeled as pulling downward from the COM.
Object COM is at x = 2 m. Force F = 10 N is applied there. What is torque about COM?,10 N,Undefined,0,20 N·m,C,Force through COM → no torque.
"If COM moves right at 4 m/s and net F = 0, what happens?",COM stops,COM accelerates,COM keeps moving at 4 m/s,Object reverses,C,No net force → constant velocity of COM.
