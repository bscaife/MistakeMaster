Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH43,Forces can act on an object without interaction,Does not understand that all forces arise from interactions between two objects or systems — no object can exert a net force on itself.
PH44,"Forces come from motion, not interaction","Thinks moving objects generate force by moving, ignoring the requirement of an interaction with another object or system."
PH45,Free-body diagrams include forces the object exerts,Incorrectly includes forces exerted *by* the object rather than only those exerted *on* the object in a free-body diagram.
PH46,All forces are contact forces,"Overlooks non-contact forces like gravity, thinking only visible touching causes forces."
PH47,Direction of force must match motion,"Thinks force always points in the same direction as the object’s velocity, ignoring that force can oppose or redirect motion."
PH48,Center of mass has no role in diagrams,Does not understand that forces should be drawn from the object's center of mass in free-body diagrams.
PH49,Force components must be shown on FBDs,"Draws components (e.g., Fᵧ, Fₓ) on free-body diagrams even though AP only requires full forces, not their trigonometric parts."
