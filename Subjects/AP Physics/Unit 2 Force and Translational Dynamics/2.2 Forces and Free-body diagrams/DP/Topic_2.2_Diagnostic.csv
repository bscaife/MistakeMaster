Question,Correct Answer,Choice A,Correct? A,Code A,Choice B,Correct? B,Code B,Choice C,Correct? C,Code C,Choice D,Correct? D,Code D,Explanation
Which of the following forces would appear on a free-body diagram for a box sitting on a table?,A,The weight of the box and the normal force from the table.,TRUE,,The force the box exerts on the table.,FALSE,PH45,Internal stress inside the box.,FALSE,PH43,The gravitational pull the box exerts on the Earth.,FALSE,PH45,FBD shows forces acting ON the object — not forces the object exerts.
What does a free-body diagram (FBD) represent?,C,The internal structure of a system.,FALSE,PH43,The motion of the object over time.,FALSE,PH44,All external forces acting on a single object.,TRUE,,The forces the object applies to others.,FALSE,PH45,FBDs isolate one object and show only the forces acting ON it.
Which is NOT a contact force?,B,Normal force.,FALSE,PH46,Gravitational force.,TRUE,PH46,Frictional force.,FALSE,PH46,Tension in a rope.,FALSE,PH46,Gravitational force acts at a distance — it’s non-contact.
Why do we not show components on FBDs?,D,Because components act in opposite directions.,FALSE,PH49,Because components don’t affect acceleration.,FALSE,PH49,Because angles remove the need for them.,FALSE,PH49,Because we show full forces— not their trigonometric parts.,TRUE,,Components are used for calculation — not for initial FBD sketching.
An object is pulled to the right with tension. Which force must oppose this to maintain equilibrium?,A,Friction to the left.,TRUE,,Normal force upward.,FALSE,PH47,Weight downward.,FALSE,PH47,The same tension again.,FALSE,PH45,To balance forces in x-direction— there must be an opposing force: friction.
A FBD shows a 5 N upward normal force and a 5 N downward gravitational force. What is the object’s vertical acceleration?,B,5 m/s²,FALSE,PH44,0 m/s²,TRUE,,9.8 m/s²,FALSE,PH44,−9.8 m/s²,FALSE,PH47,Equal and opposite forces → ∑F = 0 → a = 0.
Which force is often omitted incorrectly from sliding FBDs?,D,Weight.,FALSE,PH47,Tension.,FALSE,PH47,Normal force.,FALSE,PH47,Friction.,TRUE,PH47,Friction is common but frequently forgotten in horizontal motion problems.
What causes normal force to change?,C,Surface type only.,FALSE,PH43,The object's shape.,FALSE,PH47,The vertical component of other forces.,TRUE,,The object's horizontal motion.,FALSE,PH47,Normal force balances vertical forces— not just weight.
Why is it wrong to draw weight as upward?,A,Because weight always acts downward toward Earth.,TRUE,,Because forces can’t point upward.,FALSE,PH47,Because weight changes based on velocity.,FALSE,PH43,Because mass can’t lift itself.,FALSE,PH44,Weight is mg— always directed down in near-Earth problems.
Which force is drawn incorrectly in this FBD: box on ramp?,B,Weight straight down.,FALSE,PH47,Normal force straight up,TRUE,PH47,Friction up the incline.,FALSE,PH47,Gravity straight down,FALSE,PH47,Normal force is always perpendicular to surface — not necessarily straight up
