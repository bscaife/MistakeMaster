An object of mass m in free fall has what net force acting on it?,C,F = m / g,False,PH73,F = 0,False,PH72,F = m · g,True,,F = g / m,False,PH73,In free fall— the only force is gravity: F = m · g.
A 70 kg person stands in an elevator accelerating upward at 2 m/s². What is the normal force?,B,N = m · g,False,PH76,N = m · (g + a),True,,N = m / a,False,PH73,N = m · a,False,PH76,N = m · (g + a) = 70 × (9.8 + 2) = 826 N
A person feels weightless when the elevator accelerates downward. Why?,D,Gravity is reduced.,False,PH72,Mass becomes zero.,False,PH73,Normal force increases.,False,PH76,Normal force becomes zero due to downward acceleration.,True,,Apparent weight is normal force. In free fall— N = 0.
What is the apparent weight of a person accelerating downward at a = g?,C,W = m · g,False,PH76,W = 2 · m · g,False,PH76,W = 0,True,,W = m / g,False,PH73,Apparent weight = normal force = 0 when a = g downward.
A person stands on a scale in an elevator accelerating downward at a. What is the reading?,A,N = m · (g − a),True,,N = m · (g + a),False,PH76,N = m / a,False,PH76,N = a / m,False,PH73,Apparent weight = normal force = m · (g − a)
An astronaut in orbit appears weightless because—,B,Gravity is zero in space.,False,PH72,They are in free fall with the spacecraft.,True,,Mass cancels weight.,False,PH73,The spacecraft blocks gravitational force.,False,PH72,Weightlessness in orbit = continuous free fall around Earth.
What is the correct expression for gravitational force near Earth’s surface?,C,F = m / g,False,PH73,F = g / m,False,PH73,F = m · g,True,,F = m² · g,False,PH73,Gravitational force: F = m · g — basic definition of weight.
An object is suspended from a spring scale in a falling elevator. What does the scale read?,A,Zero — it is in free fall.,True,,The object’s weight.,False,PH76,More than mg.,False,PH76,Depends on tension.,False,PH76,In free fall— N = 0 — scale reads zero.
If gravitational field strength on Mars is gₘ = 3.7 m/s²— what is weight of 60 kg astronaut?,D,220 N,False,PH73,588 N,False,PH73,0 N,False,PH72,W = m · gₘ = 60 × 3.7 = 222 N,True,,Weight = m · g — field strength depends on planet.
How does weight differ from mass?,B,Weight is constant; mass varies.,False,PH73,Mass is constant; weight depends on gravity.,True,,Weight is measured in kg.,False,PH73,Mass depends on apparent weight.,False,PH74,Mass is intrinsic; weight is a force = m · g.
