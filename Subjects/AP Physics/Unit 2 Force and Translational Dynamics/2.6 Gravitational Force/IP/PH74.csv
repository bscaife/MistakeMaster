Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does the shape of an object affect the gravitational force acting on it?,Only if it’s a sphere,"No, gravity depends only on mass and distance","Yes, bigger objects fall harder","Yes, flat objects fall slower",B,The gravitational force is determined by mass and distance only — not shape or appearance.
What variables affect gravitational force between two objects?,Their shape and speed,The angle and area,Their color and size,Their masses and the distance between them,D,Gravitational force is proportional to m₁·m₂ / r².
"If a block and a sphere have the same mass, which experiences more gravitational force?",They experience the same force,The block,Whichever is smoother,The sphere,A,"Gravity depends only on mass, not on shape."
Why does a feather fall slower than a rock in air?,Gravity is weaker on the feather,The feather has less shape,The rock weighs more,Air resistance affects the feather more,D,"Air resistance causes slower fall, not a weaker gravitational force."
What would happen if you dropped a sphere and a cube of equal mass in a vacuum?,Both would stop falling,They would fall at the same rate,The cube would fall slower,The sphere would fall faster,B,"In a vacuum, gravity acts equally regardless of shape."
Which factor does NOT affect gravitational force?,Mass,Shape,Distance,Mass of the second object,B,Shape has no effect — only mass and distance matter.
"If two identical masses are shaped differently, what is true about the gravitational pull on them?",It depends on velocity,It is the same,It depends on surface area,It is greater on the flatter object,B,Mass determines gravity — not shape.
Two 5 kg objects are 2 m apart. What affects their gravitational force?,Their color,Their speed,Their mass and separation,Their shape,C,F ∝ m₁·m₂ / r² — shape is irrelevant.
A cube and a sphere each have mass = 10 kg. What is their weight on Earth?,98 N for both,Less for the cube,More for the sphere,Depends on air,A,Weight = m·g = 10·9.8 = 98 N — same for both.
"In a vacuum, what is the fall acceleration of a flat disk and a ball of same mass?",Faster for the ball,9.8 m/s² for both,It depends on diameter,Slower for the disk,B,"In freefall, shape doesn’t affect gravitational acceleration."
