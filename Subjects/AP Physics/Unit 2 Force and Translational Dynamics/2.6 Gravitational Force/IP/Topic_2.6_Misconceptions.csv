Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH71,Heavier objects fall faster,"Believes mass affects the rate of gravitational acceleration, not realizing all objects fall with the same acceleration in a vacuum."
PH72,Gravity only acts when falling,"Assumes gravitational force only applies when an object is moving down, not while at rest or on an incline."
PH73,Weight is mass,"Confuses mass (a measure of matter) with weight (the gravitational force on an object), treating the terms as interchangeable."
PH74,Gravitational force depends on shape,"Thinks shape or appearance affects how gravity acts on an object, instead of mass and distance."
PH75,Objects float because they are lighter,Misinterprets buoyancy as depending on 'lightness' rather than the relationship between weight and displaced fluid.
PH76,Apparent weight is always equal to actual weight,Does not recognize that normal force (apparent weight) can differ from gravitational weight when accelerating.
PH77,Field strength and force are the same,"Confuses gravitational field strength (N/kg) with the force of gravity (N), ignoring the role of mass in calculating the latter."
