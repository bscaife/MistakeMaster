Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does gravity act on an object that is sitting still?,"Yes, gravity always pulls downward regardless of motion",Only with mass greater than 5 kg,Only when the object is in freefall,"No, only if the object is falling",A,Gravity is always present and acts on all masses at all times — not just when they fall.
Why does a box sitting on a table not fall through it?,Only air pressure holds it up,Gravity is balanced by the normal force,No gravity is acting,Gravity only acts on top surfaces,B,"Gravity pulls down, but the table pushes up with an equal normal force — equilibrium."
When is gravity acting on a person?,Only in space,Only when falling,Only while jumping,"Always, whether in motion or at rest",D,Gravity acts on all objects with mass at all times on Earth.
What keeps an object on an incline from accelerating downward?,Friction or a normal force balances gravity,Air holds it still,Mass cancels out,Gravity turns off,A,Gravity is pulling down the ramp — friction or an applied force may resist motion.
Is gravity acting on a book at rest on a shelf?,"Yes, it is balanced by a normal force","No, because it’s not falling",Only if friction acts,Only if the shelf tilts,A,Gravitational force is balanced by the shelf’s support force.
What causes a hanging object to be under tension?,Inertia pushes upward,Acceleration generates force,Gravity is pulling downward,Weight disappears,C,Tension balances gravity — so gravity must be acting.
Why do people often think gravity only acts during motion?,Because mass causes it,Because friction increases,Because motion makes the force visible,Because net force = 0,C,Gravity doesn’t require movement — but its effects are more obvious when motion occurs.
A 4 kg object sits on a table. What is the gravitational force?,39.2 N,4 N,9.8 N,0 N,A,F = m·g = 4 × 9.8 = 39.2 N down — still present even at rest.
"If a box sits still and the floor pushes up with 58.8 N, what is its weight?",0 N,58.8 N,29.4 N,9.8 N,B,"In equilibrium, normal force = weight."
An object rests on an incline with no motion. What force pulls it down the slope?,None,Friction,Inertia,Gravity,D,Gravity acts down the ramp even if motion does not occur.
