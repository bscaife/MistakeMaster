Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Is gravitational field strength the same as gravitational force?,Only near Earth’s surface,"Yes, they always equal each other",Only in space,"No, field strength is force per unit mass",D,Field strength is measured in N/kg or m/s² and must be multiplied by mass to find the actual force.
What is the relationship between gravitational force and field strength?,F = g/m,F = m/g,F = g²,F = m·g,D,Gravitational force equals mass times field strength.
"If g = 9.8 N/kg and mass = 0 kg, what is gravitational force?",9.8 N,1 N,0 N,Infinite,C,F = m·g → F = 0 × 9.8 = 0 N.
What unit is used for gravitational field strength?,kg,N/kg,J,N,B,Field strength is a measure of force per unit mass — N/kg.
What quantity depends on the mass of the object?,Gravitational field,Air pressure,"Gravitational force, but not field strength",Mass itself,C,Field strength is constant at a location; force depends on object mass.
Why does the Moon have a smaller field strength than Earth?,It has less mass,It rotates faster,It is farther from the Sun,It moves slower,A,Field strength is determined by the planet or moon’s own mass and radius.
Which concept is often confused with gravitational force?,Velocity,Friction,Gravitational field strength,Normal force,C,g is often mistaken for the total force — but it’s per unit mass.
Object has mass = 4 kg and is in g = 10 N/kg. What is gravitational force?,10 N,4 N,0.4 N,40 N,D,F = m·g = 4 × 10 = 40 N.
"At a point in space, g = 2 N/kg. Object has m = 5 kg. What is F?",10 N,5 N,2 N,7 N,A,F = m·g = 5 × 2 = 10 N.
A 10 kg object weighs 98 N. What is g at its location?,0.1 N/kg,98 N/kg,10 N/kg,9.8 N/kg,D,g = F/m = 98 / 10 = 9.8 N/kg.
