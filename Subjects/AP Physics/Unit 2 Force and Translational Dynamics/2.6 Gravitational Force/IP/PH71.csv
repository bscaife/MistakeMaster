Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Do heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones in the absence of air resistance?,"No, all objects fall at the same rate in a vacuum",Only if the objects have the same shape,Only if dropped from a high place,"Yes, heavier objects accelerate more",A,"In a vacuum, all objects experience the same gravitational acceleration regardless of mass (g = 9.8 m/s²)."
What causes objects to fall at the same rate in freefall?,They experience the same acceleration due to gravity,They are pulled more strongly,Their shape is balanced,They push against the air less,A,Gravitational acceleration is independent of an object's mass.
Why does a feather fall slower than a rock in air?,It has less inertia,Gravity pulls it less,Air resistance affects it more,It is less massive,C,"Air resistance, not gravity, causes the difference — gravity pulls equally on both."
Which statement correctly describes objects in freefall?,Heavier objects fall faster,All objects fall at the same rate when air resistance is negligible,Lighter objects fall slower,Mass determines fall rate,B,"Without air resistance, mass has no effect on fall rate."
"If two objects are dropped from the same height at the same time in a vacuum, what will happen?",The lighter one floats,The heavier one lands first,They will land at the same time,Only one will fall,C,Same gravitational acceleration means they hit the ground together.
What quantity remains constant for all objects in freefall (neglecting air)?,Acceleration,Force,Speed,Velocity,A,Acceleration due to gravity is constant at 9.8 m/s² for all masses.
Why is the claim that heavier objects fall faster incorrect?,Because they have more mass,Because they compress faster,Because air lifts them,Because acceleration is the same regardless of mass,D,Only air resistance causes differing fall times — gravity acts equally.
"If object A and object B fall in a vacuum, what is their acceleration?",More for B,9.8 m/s² for both,More for A,It depends on mass,B,Acceleration is due to gravity alone: g = 9.8 m/s² for all objects.
Two rocks fall with no air resistance. What will be their fall time?,Shorter for heavier one,Longer for lighter one,The same,Depends on shape,C,Same height + same acceleration = same fall time.
Mass = 2 kg and 10 kg objects dropped from 10 m. Ignore air. Who lands first?,2 kg first,Depends on velocity,They land at the same time,10 kg first,C,g = 9.8 m/s² → same acceleration and time of fall.
