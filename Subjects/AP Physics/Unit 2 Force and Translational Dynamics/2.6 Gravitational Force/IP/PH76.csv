Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Is your apparent weight always equal to your actual weight?,"No, it changes if you are accelerating","Yes, they are always the same",Only in elevators,Only on Earth,A,Apparent weight is the normal force — it differs from actual weight when accelerating.
What happens to your apparent weight in an accelerating elevator going upward?,It increases,It stays the same,It becomes zero,It decreases,A,Upward acceleration increases normal force — you feel heavier.
What happens to your apparent weight in freefall?,It increases,It equals actual weight,It reverses direction,It becomes zero,D,No normal force acts during freefall — apparent weight is zero.
What force do bathroom scales actually measure?,Friction,Gravitational weight,The normal force,Mass,C,Scales measure the upward normal force — not gravitational weight directly.
"In a downward-accelerating elevator, how does your apparent weight change?",It decreases,It stays the same,It becomes negative,It increases,A,Downward acceleration reduces the normal force.
When is apparent weight equal to actual weight?,Only when mass is large,Only in space,Always,When there is no vertical acceleration,D,"If net acceleration is zero, normal = weight."
What does the normal force represent on a scale?,Inertia,Gravitational field,Actual weight,Apparent weight,D,Normal force is what you feel as 'weight' — it can vary.
Mass = 50 kg. Elevator accelerates up at 2 m/s². What is apparent weight?,0 N,100 N,590 N,490 N,C,N = m(g + a) = 50(9.8 + 2) = 50(11.8) = 590 N.
Mass = 60 kg. Elevator goes down at a = 1 m/s². What is apparent weight?,0 N,600 N,588 N,528 N,D,N = m(g − a) = 60(8.8) = 528 N.
"Mass = 70 kg. In freefall, what is apparent weight?",700 N,0 N,686 N,70 N,B,In freefall → no normal force → apparent weight = 0.
