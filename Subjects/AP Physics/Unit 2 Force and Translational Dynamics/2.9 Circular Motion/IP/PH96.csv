Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does acceleration always mean changing speed?,Only slowing down counts,"No, changing direction at constant speed also means acceleration","Yes, only speed changes count",Only speeding up counts,B,Acceleration is any change in velocity — including changes in direction even when speed is constant.
"In circular motion at constant speed, is there acceleration?",Only if mass is increasing,Only at turning points,"No, speed is constant","Yes, because the direction of velocity is changing",D,Centripetal acceleration results from constant directional change.
What causes centripetal acceleration?,An increase in speed,A continuous change in velocity direction,A drop in kinetic energy,Net torque,B,"Even if speed is constant, turning creates acceleration toward the center."
What is true of an object in uniform circular motion?,It is accelerating because its direction is changing,It is not accelerating,It moves at constant velocity,It has increasing mass,A,Constant direction change = constant acceleration.
Which of these indicates acceleration?,Change in direction only,Constant motion,Change in speed only,Constant position,A,Acceleration = any change in velocity → direction or magnitude.
Which path shows acceleration with constant speed?,A stationary point,A straight line,A parabolic arc,A circle,D,Only circular motion involves directional acceleration at constant speed.
Why does a rider on a merry-go-round feel pushed sideways?,Because friction pulls inward,Because gravity reverses,Because acceleration points inward while inertia resists turning,Because speed increases,C,Inertia keeps the rider in a straight line while the platform turns underneath them.
Object moving at 10 m/s in a circle of radius 2 m. What is acceleration?,50 m/s² inward,5 m/s² tangential,20 m/s² outward,0,A,a = v²/r = 100 / 2 = 50 m/s² inward.
Object moves in circle at constant speed. What is acceleration direction?,Same as motion,None,Upward,Toward center,D,Centripetal acceleration points toward the center of the circle.
"Circular motion: speed = 12 m/s, radius = 3 m. Acceleration = ?",48 m/s²,4 m/s²,12 m/s²,36 m/s²,A,a = v²/r = 144 / 3 = 48 m/s² inward.
