Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH92,Objects in circular motion have outward force,"Believes in a 'centrifugal force' pushing outward, rather than recognizing centripetal force as the inward force maintaining circular motion."
PH93,Velocity and acceleration point in same direction,"Fails to recognize that in uniform circular motion, velocity is tangent to the path while acceleration is directed inward."
PH94,Faster speed means greater outward force,"Thinks an outward force increases with speed, confusing reaction feeling (inertia) with actual inward centripetal force."
PH95,Centripetal force is a new kind of force,"Treats centripetal force as a standalone force rather than the net inward force provided by gravity, tension, or friction."
PH96,Acceleration means changing speed only,Does not understand that changing direction (even at constant speed) constitutes acceleration in circular motion.
PH97,Object continues circular path if force is removed,"Thinks that removing centripetal force would keep the object moving in a circle, instead of moving in a straight tangent line."
PH98,Tangential and centripetal acceleration are the same,"Confuses acceleration toward the center with changes in speed, not recognizing they are distinct components."
