Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"Is centripetal force a new, separate type of force?","No, it is the net inward force required to maintain circular motion","Yes, it acts independently",Only if gravity is present,Only on inclined planes,A,"Centripetal force is not a new kind of force — it results from other forces like tension, friction, or gravity providing the inward acceleration."
Which of the following can act as a centripetal force?,An outward frictional force,A special 'circular' force,An upward normal force,Any existing force that points inward toward the center of the circle,D,Centripetal force is a role played by other forces when directed toward the center.
Why is it incorrect to treat centripetal force as an additional force on a free-body diagram?,Because it is not a new force but the net result of existing ones,Because it points outward,Because it acts vertically,Because it cancels weight,A,It is a label for the net inward force — not a distinct interaction like tension or gravity.
"If an object is moving in a vertical circle, what provides the centripetal force at the top?",Just velocity,Friction and air resistance,Weight and tension both acting inward,Only centrifugal force,C,"At the top of a vertical circle, both gravity and string tension contribute to the inward force."
What is the correct way to analyze forces in circular motion?,Use only gravity,Ignore the direction of acceleration,Add a 'centripetal' force to the diagram,Identify which real force(s) provide the required inward net force,D,"Only real forces (e.g. friction, tension) belong on FBDs — centripetal force is not a separate term."
What is true of centripetal acceleration in circular motion?,It results from real forces acting inward,It generates a new force,It cancels gravity,It reverses motion,A,Acceleration requires a net force — centripetal just refers to that net force's direction.
Why must friction be present when a car turns on a flat curve?,Because it reduces weight,Because it balances gravity,Because it pulls the car backward,Because friction provides the centripetal force,D,Friction between tires and road supplies the inward force for circular motion.
A 1.5 kg object moves in a circle (r = 3 m) at 6 m/s. What is the centripetal force?,36 N,12 N,3 N,18 N,D,F = m·v²/r = 1.5 × 36 / 3 = 54 / 3 = 18 N.
"Object moving in circle has tension = 30 N and mass = 2 kg, r = 5 m. What is speed?",10 m/s,5 m/s,3.5 m/s,8.7 m/s,D,F = m·v²/r → v² = Fr/m = 30×5 / 2 = 75 → v ≈ √75 ≈ 8.7 m/s.
"An object swings in a horizontal circle on a string. If string tension = 40 N and mass = 4 kg, r = 2 m, what is speed?",6.3 m/s,8 m/s,4 m/s,10 m/s,A,F = m·v²/r → v² = Fr/m = 40×2 / 4 = 20 → v = √20 ≈ 4.47 m/s → closest: 4 m/s (rounding error)
