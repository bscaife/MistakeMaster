Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"In circular motion, what happens to the net force as speed increases?",Weight increases,Friction cancels velocity,An outward force increases,The required inward (centripetal) force increases,D,"F = m·v²/r — faster speed requires more centripetal (inward) force, not outward force."
Why do people feel pushed outward in a turning car?,An outward force pulls them,Inertia resists the change in direction while the car turns inward,Friction fails,Gravity tilts,B,There is no actual outward force — this sensation comes from the body's inertia.
What is the direction of the actual force keeping an object moving in a circle?,Away from the center,None — it's canceled,Toward the center,Along the velocity vector,C,Centripetal force points inward — no real outward force exists.
"If an object in circular motion doubles its speed, what happens to the required centripetal force?",It stays the same,It doubles,It decreases,It increases by a factor of 4,D,F = m·v²/r → doubling v quadruples the required inward force.
Why is it incorrect to say that faster speed increases an outward force?,Because mass disappears,Because weight changes,Because speed is canceled by gravity,Because no outward force exists — only the need for more inward force increases,D,The only real force involved is centripetal — always directed inward.
What is the role of friction in a car taking a curve?,It cancels inertia,It provides the centripetal force by acting inward,It pushes the car outward,It lifts the car,B,Friction between tires and road provides inward force to change direction.
Which of the following is a fictitious force used in rotating frames of reference?,Centrifugal force,Weight,Centripetal force,Normal force,A,Centrifugal force is an apparent force felt in a rotating frame — not a real force in Newtonian mechanics.
"m = 3 kg, r = 2 m, v = 4 m/s. What is centripetal force?",48 N outward,12 N outward,24 N inward,0 N,C,F = m·v²/r = 3·16/2 = 48/2 = 24 N inward.
An object in circular motion has a = 36 m/s² inward. What happens if speed doubles?,a stays 36,a halves,a becomes zero,a becomes 144 m/s²,D,a = v²/r → doubling speed = 4× acceleration.
"Car takes a turn. If speed triples, how much more centripetal force is needed?",No change,Nine times more,Half as much,Three times,B,F ∝ v² → (3v)² = 9v².
