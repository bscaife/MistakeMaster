Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"If an object is moving in a circle at constant speed, what is the direction of the net force acting on it?",There is no net force,Away from the center,In the direction of motion,Toward the center of the circle,D,Centripetal force always points inward — there is no outward force acting on the object.
Why does an object in circular motion not fly outward despite its inertia?,Because its speed balances the force,Because friction pulls it outward,"Because the net force is directed inward, keeping it in the circular path",Because mass cancels gravity,C,Inertia would cause tangential motion — the inward net force prevents that from occurring.
Which of the following best describes the so-called 'centrifugal force'?,It is the actual force pulling objects outward,It balances centripetal force,It is a fictitious force perceived in a rotating reference frame,It acts in real space,C,Centrifugal force is a non-inertial (fictitious) force experienced in rotating frames — not a real interaction.
What happens to an object if the centripetal force is removed while in circular motion?,It flies outward due to centrifugal force,It falls inward,It moves in a straight line tangent to the circle,It comes to rest,C,"Without inward force, the object moves tangentially due to inertia."
Why is it incorrect to say an object in circular motion has an outward force acting on it?,Because it feels heavier,Because velocity increases,Because the system is frictionless,Because all real forces maintaining circular motion point inward,D,The only real force is inward — outward sensations are inertial frame illusions.
"In uniform circular motion, what is the direction of acceleration?",Zero,Along the path of motion,Outward from the center,Toward the center of the circle,D,Acceleration = change in velocity direction → always inward (centripetal).
"When a car makes a sharp left turn, why do passengers feel pushed to the right?",Because gravity tilts,Because their inertia resists the change in direction and the car moves left beneath them,Because centrifugal force acts outward,Because a force pushes them right,B,It’s inertia — they continue straight while the car curves inward beneath them.
A 2.0 kg object moves in a circle of radius 0.5 m at 6 m/s. What is the net force?,36 N outward,144 N inward,72 N outward,12 N tangential,B,F = m·v²/r = 2·6²/0.5 = 72/0.5 = 144 N (inward).
Object moving at 10 m/s in a 4 m radius circle has centripetal acceleration of:,0,5 m/s² tangential,40 m/s² outward,25 m/s² inward,D,a = v²/r = 100/4 = 25 m/s² inward.
"Ball on string swings in horizontal circle. m = 0.8 kg, v = 3 m/s, r = 0.6 m. What is tension in string?",9.6 N,14 N,0 N,12 N,D,F = m·v²/r = 0.8·9/0.6 = 7.2/0.6 = 12 N (inward tension).
