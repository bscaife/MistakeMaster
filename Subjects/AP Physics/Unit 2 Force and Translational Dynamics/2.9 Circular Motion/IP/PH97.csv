Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What happens if the centripetal force on an object in circular motion is suddenly removed?,It spirals inward,It comes to rest,It continues in the circular path,The object moves in a straight line tangent to the circular path,D,"Without inward net force, inertia carries the object straight at the point of release."
Why does an object in circular motion not follow the curve if the net force disappears?,Because friction redirects it,Because inertia causes it to continue in a straight line,Because gravity reverses,Because it rotates in place,B,Newton’s first law: An object in motion remains in straight-line motion unless acted on by a net force.
What path does a rock follow after being released from a string while spinning it in a circle?,Moves outward radially,Continues in circle,Straight line tangent to the point of release,Drops vertically,C,"At the instant of release, the rock’s velocity is tangent to the circle."
What provides the continuous turning in circular motion?,A continuous inward (centripetal) force,Rotational inertia,An outward pulling force,Tangential momentum,A,"Centripetal force is what maintains the turn — without it, the object moves straight."
Why is it incorrect to say an object keeps turning after force is removed?,Because gravity takes over,Because friction reverses it,Because no force means no acceleration toward the center,Because the object is weightless,C,Turning requires constant inward acceleration — which requires an inward force.
What is true of velocity at the instant an object is released from circular motion?,It is tangent to the circle,It is inward,It is zero,It points toward the center,A,The object’s inertia carries it in the direction it was moving at release: tangent.
"If an object tied to a string moving in a circle breaks free, which direction will it go?",Around the circle,In a straight line tangent to the circle,Upward,Inward toward the center,B,Inertia makes it fly off along its existing velocity vector — which is tangent.
"A 1.5 kg object is moving in a circle at 6 m/s with radius 0.5 m. If the force is cut, what happens?",It stops,It accelerates outward,It moves inward,It flies off in a straight line tangent to the path,D,"F = m·v²/r — but once force is removed, motion follows the tangent."
What is the direction of motion of a 3 kg mass after string tension is lost during circular motion?,Radial outward,Centripetal,Vertical downward,Tangential,D,Velocity remains tangent when released.
"Centripetal force = 18 N. Mass = 2 kg. Radius = 1 m. If force is removed, speed is?",6 m/s,9 m/s,0 m/s,3 m/s,D,F = m·v²/r → 18 = 2·v²/1 → v² = 9 → v = 3 m/s (still the speed at release).
