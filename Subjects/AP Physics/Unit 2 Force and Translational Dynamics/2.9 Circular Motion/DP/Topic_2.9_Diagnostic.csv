Question,Correct Answer,Choice A,Correct? A,Code A,Choice B,Correct? B,Code B,Choice C,Correct? C,Code C,Choice D,Correct? D,Code D,Explanation
An object moves in a circle of radius r with speed v. What is the expression for its centripetal acceleration?,B,a = v · r,FALSE,PH96,a = v² / r,TRUE,,a = r² / v,FALSE,PH96,a = 1 / (v · r),FALSE,PH96,Centripetal acceleration: a = v² / r
What is the net force on a mass m in uniform circular motion at speed v and radius r?,A,F = m · v² / r,TRUE,,F = m · r / v²,FALSE,PH96,F = v / m,FALSE,PH95,F = r / v,FALSE,PH94,From F = m·a— and a = v²/r → F = m·v² / r
A car rounds a turn of radius 50 m at 10 m/s. What is its required centripetal force if m = 800 kg?,D,400 N,FALSE,PH96,1000 N,FALSE,PH96,640 N,FALSE,PH96,600 N,TRUE,,F = 800 × 10² / 50 = 800 × 100 / 50 = 1600 N
If a string breaks while spinning an object— which direction does it go?,C,Toward the center.,FALSE,PH92,Outward in a spiral.,FALSE,PH92,Tangent to the circular path.,TRUE,,Upward.,FALSE,PH92,No net inward force → object moves in straight-line tangent.
Which force is incorrectly assumed to act outward during circular motion?,D,Friction.,FALSE,,Gravity.,FALSE,,Tension.,FALSE,,Centrifugal force.,TRUE,PH92,Centrifugal force is fictitious — only centripetal (inward) is real.
What is angular acceleration if an object speeds up uniformly around a circle?,A,α = ∆ω / ∆t,TRUE,,α = ω / r,FALSE,PH94,α = r / ω²,FALSE,PH94,α = ω² / r,FALSE,PH94,Angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity.
An object travels in a circle at constant speed. What changes?,C,Speed.,FALSE,PH93,Mass.,FALSE,PH95,Direction of velocity.,TRUE,,Inertia.,FALSE,PH95,Even with constant speed— velocity changes because direction changes.
How does centripetal force relate to angular speed ω— mass m— and radius r?,B,F = m · ω / r,FALSE,PH98,F = m · r · ω²,TRUE,,F = r / m · ω²,FALSE,PH98,F = m · r / ω²,FALSE,PH98,F = m · v² / r → v = r·ω → F = m · r · ω²
What happens to required centripetal force if speed doubles?,D,It stays the same.,FALSE,PH96,It doubles.,FALSE,PH96,It halves.,FALSE,PH96,It quadruples.,TRUE,,F = m·v² / r → if v doubles— F increases by factor of 4
An object moves in a circle at increasing speed. What does the velocity vector do?,B,It remains constant in direction.,FALSE,PH93,It changes in both magnitude and direction.,TRUE,,It stays tangent always with same length.,FALSE,PH94,It points inward.,FALSE,PH92,Non-uniform circular motion → v changes in magnitude and direction.
