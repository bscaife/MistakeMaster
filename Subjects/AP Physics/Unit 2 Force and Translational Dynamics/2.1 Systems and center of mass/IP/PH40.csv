Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What changes a system's total momentum?,Internal forces,Changing one mass,Reversing direction,External force only,D,Only external forces can change the momentum of a system.
What happens when an object inside a system exerts force on another inside the same system?,Gravity cancels,System accelerates,Momentum increases,No change in total system momentum,D,Internal forces cancel within a system; net momentum is unchanged.
When does changing one object affect the whole system’s motion?,Only if friction exists,Always,Only with external force,Never,C,Internal actions don’t alter system momentum unless an external force acts.
Two skaters push each other. What is true about their system?,Total velocity becomes zero,Mass increases,Only one gains speed,Total momentum stays constant,D,Forces are internal; momentum is conserved for the system.
Why does tossing a ball forward cause a cart to roll back?,To conserve momentum within the system,Because ball is heavier,Due to friction,Only if mass is large,A,Internal force (tossing ball) redistributes momentum between parts of the system.
Pulling on a rope inside a box changes:,System’s total mass,"Individual tensions, not system momentum",Weight only,Nothing,B,Internal actions don’t affect system momentum externally.
Which of these changes system motion?,An internal mass shift,Pushing from inside,An external force,An internal rope tension,C,Only external forces change the motion of a system.
"Two blocks, total mass 5 kg, pushed with 10 N. Acceleration?",2 m/s²,5 m/s²,10 m/s²,0.5 m/s²,A,a = F / m = 10 / 5 = 2 m/s².
Two 1 kg skaters push off. One goes 4 m/s right. Other’s speed?,2 m/s right,0 m/s,4 m/s left,8 m/s left,C,Momentum conservation: equal and opposite speeds due to equal masses.
"Mass A = 2 kg, Mass B = 1 kg, vₐ = 3 m/s. What v_b conserves momentum (initial total = 0)?",−6 m/s,3 m/s,−3 m/s,−2 m/s,A,pₐ + p_b = 0 → 2·3 + 1·v = 0 → v = −6 m/s.
