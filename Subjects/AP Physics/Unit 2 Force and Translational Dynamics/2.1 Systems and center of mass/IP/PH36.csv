Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"In physics, what can a system include?",Only massless parts,Any group of interacting objects,Only forces,Only one object,B,"A system is defined by what the observer chooses to include, not limited to a single object."
Why define a system in a problem?,To analyze internal and external forces,To eliminate acceleration,To measure gravity,To isolate a single mass,A,The system boundary determines which forces are considered external.
Two blocks are tied together. Can they be treated as one system?,Only if friction is zero,"No, they must be separate",Only if they are the same mass,"Yes, they form a combined system",D,Multiple objects can be grouped and treated as one system.
A system of objects can include:,Only one object,Only invisible forces,Only one direction,Multiple masses and their connections,D,Systems can contain several connected or interacting parts.
How does defining a system help problem solving?,It reduces mass,It allows applying Newton’s laws to the whole group,It fixes velocity,It removes all forces,B,"By choosing a system, you determine how Newton’s second law applies."
A cart and string are pulled. Which is a valid system?,Only the cart,Cart + string + mass,Only the string,Only external forces,B,You can group all components together into one system.
What is internal force within a system?,Force between parts of the system,Force from ground,Gravitational pull only,Frictional force with air,A,Internal forces act between parts included in the defined system.
Two blocks of 2 kg and 3 kg are pulled together. What is system mass?,1 kg,5 kg,3 kg,2 kg,B,Total system mass = sum of components: 2 + 3 = 5 kg.
"Block A = 1 kg, Block B = 2 kg, connected by a rope. System acceleration from 9 N force?",9 m/s²,4.5 m/s²,3 m/s²,2 m/s²,C,a = F / total m = 9 / (1+2) = 3 m/s².
Pulley lifts two equal masses. Total system mass?,One mass only,Sum of both masses,Mass of pulley only,Zero,B,System includes both masses if you define it that way.
