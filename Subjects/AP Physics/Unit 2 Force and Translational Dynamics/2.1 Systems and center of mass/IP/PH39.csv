Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does a system need a visible center to have a center of mass?,Only for solids,"No, COM can be defined mathematically","Yes, it must be seen",Only for circles,B,"COM is calculated from mass distribution, not physical symmetry or visibility."
Can asymmetric systems have a center of mass?,Yes,Only with equal mass parts,No,Only if spinning,A,"Every object or system has a defined COM, even if lopsided."
How is center of mass determined?,By cutting the object,By choosing geometric center,Only visually,Using mass distribution and geometry,D,COM = average position of all mass elements weighted by mass.
"If a system looks unbalanced, can it still have a COM?","No, it must be symmetrical",Only if spinning,Only if resting,"Yes, located based on mass, not appearance",D,COM is mathematical; symmetry is not required.
A bumpy asteroid has no geometric center. COM?,Does not exist,"Exists, defined by mass layout",Must be center of image,Only near largest bump,B,Even irregular bodies have a COM found through integration.
What makes COM unique?,It must be labeled,It represents the weighted balance point,It is center of color,It’s where all forces act,B,COM is the balance point determined by mass and position.
Why is COM sometimes outside an object?,Because it’s invisible,Because it's imaginary,Because of rotation,Because it depends on how mass is distributed,D,COM is not tied to physical material boundaries.
Object A: 1 kg at x = 0. Object B: 3 kg at x = 6. COM?,1.5 m,3 m,4.5 m,2 m,C,COM = (1·0 + 3·6)/(1+3) = 18/4 = 4.5 m.
Two unequal masses at x = 2 and x = 6. Heavier mass at x = 6. COM lies:,Closer to x = 2,Closer to x = 6,Exactly in the middle,Outside the object,B,COM shifts toward more massive object.
L-shaped system with equal masses. Where is COM?,At midpoint,At balance point of arms,At corner,At origin,B,COM found by averaging mass positions; may be in empty space.
