Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What determines the total mass of a system?,The sum of all parts,Just the heaviest part,Its center,Only moving objects,A,System mass is the total of all individual masses included.
Center of mass of a system depends on:,The shape,Only internal forces,The outermost object,Mass and position of all components,D,COM is the mass-weighted average position of all parts.
"If one mass in a system moves, what happens to the system’s center of mass?",It always stays still,It can shift,It resets to zero,It depends on friction,B,Moving parts may shift the COM of the system.
System acceleration is based on:,Internal gravity,One object only,Total external force and total mass,Lightest part,C,a₍sys₎ = F₍ext₎ / m₍total₎.
A system’s momentum is the:,Velocity of largest object,Force on center,Sum of momenta of all parts,Mass × height,C,Total momentum = ∑(m·v) for each part.
Can removing a mass change the COM?,Only with rotation,No,Only if at rest,Yes,D,COM depends on which masses are included.
Which affects a system’s total kinetic energy?,Only COM,Only gravity,Only tension,Mass and speed of each part,D,Kinetic energy is calculated from each part’s mass and motion.
Mass A = 2 kg at 0 m. Mass B = 6 kg at 3 m. COM?,2.25 m,3 m,0.75 m,1.5 m,A,x₍cm₎ = (2·0 + 6·3)/(2+6) = 18/8 = 2.25 m.
Two blocks move right at 2 m/s and 4 m/s. Masses: 1 kg and 3 kg. p₍sys₎?,5 kg·m/s,6 kg·m/s,8 kg·m/s,14 kg·m/s,D,p = 1·2 + 3·4 = 2 + 12 = 14 kg·m/s.
Force = 20 N applied to 4 kg system. a₍sys₎?,4 m/s²,2 m/s²,10 m/s²,5 m/s²,D,a = F / m = 20 / 4 = 5 m/s².
