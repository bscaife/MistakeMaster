Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH36,The system is just one object,Thinks a 'system' must be a single object rather than a group of interacting objects modeled together.
PH37,System behavior is the same as any part,"Assumes every part of a system behaves identically to the whole, ignoring internal variation or interactions."
PH38,Center of mass is always inside an object,Does not realize that the center of mass can lie outside the physical material of an object or system.
PH39,All systems must have a visible center,Thinks systems without symmetry cannot have a center of mass or that it must be marked physically.
PH40,Changing one object changes the system,Fails to recognize that only external forces or interactions can alter a system’s momentum or motion as a whole.
PH41,System properties don’t depend on parts,"Ignores that the total mass, position, and behavior of a system are derived from its components."
PH42,Internal forces can change system motion,"Believes that forces between parts of a system (e.g., pushing or pulling) can change its center-of-mass motion."
