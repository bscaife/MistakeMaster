A two-mass system has m₁ = 2 kg at x₁ = 0 m and m₂ = 6 kg at x₂ = 4 m. What is the system’s center of mass?,C,2 m,FALSE,PH38,1 m,FALSE,PH39,3 m,TRUE,,0 m,FALSE,PH36,x₍cₘ₎ = (∑mᵢ·xᵢ) ⁄ (∑mᵢ) = (2·0 + 6·4)/(2+6) = 24/8 = 3 m.
A rocket in space explodes into two equal-mass fragments. What happens to the center of mass motion?,D,It accelerates in both directions.,FALSE,PH40,It jumps toward the larger fragment.,FALSE,PH38,It moves with the faster fragment.,FALSE,PH37,It continues with the original velocity.,TRUE,,In the absence of external force— center of mass continues unchanged.
Which best explains why a system’s COM can lie outside its physical body?,A,COM depends on mass distribution— not object shape.,TRUE,,It only happens if the object is accelerating.,FALSE,PH38,COM exists only for moving systems.,FALSE,PH36,It happens when mass is unequal.,FALSE,PH39,COM is a calculated location based on mᵢ·xᵢ — it doesn’t have to be inside.
Which object would have a COM closest to its edge?,B,A uniform disk.,FALSE,PH41,A hammer with a heavy head.,TRUE,,A cube of equal density.,FALSE,PH41,A cylinder of uniform density,FALSE,PH41,The COM shifts toward the concentrated mass — the heavy end of the hammer.
Why is COM useful in analyzing collisions?,C,It tells where friction acts.,FALSE,PH42,It tracks rotational energy.,FALSE,PH41,Its motion is predictable if external force is known.,TRUE,,It determines pressure applied.,FALSE,PH39,COM responds to net external force — it follows F = ma.
A system of two blocks accelerates to the right. What must be true?,A,There is a net external force to the right.,TRUE,,Internal friction caused the motion.,FALSE,PH40,One block must be more massive.,FALSE,PH41,The system is not accelerating.,FALSE,PH36,Only external forces change COM acceleration.
Which action would NOT change a system’s center of mass?,D,Removing one mass.,FALSE,PH36,Shifting internal mass positions.,FALSE,PH41,Adding a new external object.,FALSE,PH36,Rotating the system in place.,TRUE,,COM is about position— not orientation.
Two masses on a frictionless surface push off each other. What happens?,C,Both accelerate in same direction.,FALSE,PH42,Larger mass moves faster.,FALSE,PH37,Both move in opposite directions— COM stays constant.,TRUE,,System gains momentum.,FALSE,PH40,No external force → momentum conserved— COM stays still.
A student draws all forces inside a system on an FBD. What is wrong?,B,Internal forces should point outward.,FALSE,PH42,Internal forces should not be shown on a system FBD.,TRUE,,All forces should cancel.,FALSE,PH40,Mass should be split.,FALSE,PH39,Only external forces affect system motion. Internal forces cancel.
What defines the COM for a continuous object?,A,It is the average position of the distributed mass.,TRUE,,It is the heaviest part.,FALSE,PH41,It must lie within the material.,FALSE,PH38,It depends on rotation.,FALSE,PH39,COM = ∑mᵢxᵢ/∑mᵢ — applies to continuous as well as discrete systems.
