Code,Misconception Title,Misconception Description
PH64,Net force means motion,"Believes that if there is a net force on an object, it must be moving (not just accelerating)."
PH65,No motion means no force,"Assumes that stationary objects have no forces acting on them, ignoring the possibility of balanced forces."
PH66,Heavier objects accelerate more,Believes that greater mass leads to greater acceleration under the same net force.
PH67,Mass causes force,"Confuses mass with force, treating mass as something that directly “pushes” rather than resists acceleration."
PH68,Constant force means constant velocity,"Fails to recognize that constant net force causes constant acceleration, not constant velocity."
PH69,Net force is always in the direction of motion,"Assumes force must be in the same direction as the object’s motion, even during slowing or turning."
PH70,All forces on an object add algebraically without direction,"Ignores vector nature of force, simply adds or subtracts magnitudes regardless of direction."
