Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can net force act opposite to direction of motion?,"Yes, during slowing down","No, force must match motion",Only with friction,Only in circular paths,A,"When slowing down, net force acts opposite to velocity."
What causes a change in velocity direction?,Balanced forces,More gravity,A force not aligned with velocity,Faster motion,C,"Force and velocity can differ — e.g., centripetal force points inward, not along velocity."
"Object is moving right, net force left. What happens?",It slows down,It stays still,It speeds up,It reverses,A,Force opposite velocity leads to deceleration.
When is net force perpendicular to motion?,When mass is constant,Only in freefall,In circular motion,At rest,C,Centripetal force is always perpendicular to the direction of velocity.
"If an object is turning, what is true about net force?",It equals velocity,It matches motion,It points toward the center of the curve,It disappears,C,Turning requires a net force that changes velocity’s direction — inward.
Object moves left but net force is right. What happens?,It slows down,It stays constant,It accelerates left,It speeds up,A,Force against motion causes deceleration.
Which case shows force NOT matching motion?,A block sliding at constant speed,A ball thrown upward,A car accelerating,A falling object,B,"Velocity is upward, but gravity (net force) points downward."
"Object moves at 6 m/s left. Net F = 3 N right, m = 1.5 kg. a = ?",9 m/s² right,2 m/s² right,3 m/s² left,4 m/s² left,B,a = F/m = 3 / 1.5 = 2 m/s² (opposite to velocity).
Ball slows from 10 m/s to 5 m/s in 2 s. a = ?,2.5 m/s²,−2.5 m/s²,0,7.5 m/s²,B,a = (5 − 10) / 2 = −2.5 m/s² → net force is opposite velocity.
Car turns right at constant speed. Net force points:,Downward,Toward center of turn,Same as motion,Away from turn,B,Net force causes directional change — inward in curved motion.
