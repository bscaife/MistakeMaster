Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does a net force cause?,Motion automatically,Mass to change,Acceleration,Velocity to stay constant,C,"Fₙₑₜ causes a change in motion (acceleration), not motion itself — an object can be at rest and still accelerate."
Can an object have a net force but not yet be moving?,Only with gravity,"No, force means motion","Yes, if it's just beginning to accelerate",Only if mass is large,C,"Force causes acceleration, which *leads* to motion — not instant speed."
Object with Fₙₑₜ > 0 must:,Accelerate,Stop,Be moving already,Change mass,A,"Net force produces a change in velocity (acceleration), regardless of starting speed."
"If an object is at rest and net force is applied, what happens?",It begins accelerating,It moves instantly,Friction cancels everything,It remains still,A,"It will start to change velocity — i.e., accelerate from rest."
Which situation has net force but no motion yet?,Object at rest just before launch,Frictionless glider,Floating object in water,Block in constant motion,A,Net force can act on a stationary object and begin to accelerate it.
"An object is moving, but Fₙₑₜ = 0. What happens?",It speeds up,It stops immediately,It keeps moving at constant speed,It turns,C,No net force = no acceleration = motion continues unchanged.
What’s needed to *start* motion?,High velocity,Net force,Balanced force,Inertia,B,Force initiates acceleration → motion.
"Box at rest gets F = 10 N, m = 2 kg. What’s its acceleration?",2 m/s²,0 m/s²,5 m/s²,10 m/s²,C,"a = F/m = 10/2 = 5 m/s² — from rest, it begins to accelerate."
Car moves at 20 m/s with Fₙₑₜ = 0. What is acceleration?,20,Depends on mass,0,10,C,No net force = no change in motion = constant velocity.
Object is stationary. Fₙₑₜ = 15 N. What happens?,It moves instantly at 15 m/s,It gains weight,It stays still,It accelerates from rest,D,A net force causes it to begin changing velocity from zero — acceleration begins.
