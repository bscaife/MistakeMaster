Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
How should forces be combined?,Only in pairs,Only by subtracting,By just adding magnitudes,As vectors with direction,D,Forces are vectors — direction matters in calculating net force.
Two equal forces act in opposite directions. What’s the net force?,The sum of magnitudes,Twice the force,Zero,Depends on mass,C,"Equal and opposite vectors cancel out, yielding a net force of zero."
"Force A = 10 N right, Force B = 6 N left. What is net force direction?",Upward,None,Right,Left,C,10 N − 6 N = 4 N to the right — direction determines result.
Why can’t we just add all force values together?,Because they’re unequal,Because forces have direction,Because mass changes,Because friction acts too,B,Net force depends on vector sum — not just arithmetic total.
What happens if forces of 5 N and 5 N act in opposite directions?,They reverse,They become 2.5 N,They cancel,They add to 10 N,C,"Opposite, equal vectors sum to 0 — not added."
Which operation combines forces correctly?,Algebraic addition only,Scalar sum,Vector addition,Averaging,C,You must account for both magnitude and direction when combining forces.
How is net force different from total force magnitude?,It doubles mass,It reverses speed,It equals gravity,It accounts for direction,D,"Net force = vector sum, not scalar sum of all forces."
10 N right + 6 N left = ?,10 N,4 N right,16 N,4 N left,B,Net force = 10 − 6 = 4 N right.
"F₁ = 3 N right, F₂ = 7 N right. Net force?",4 N right,10 N left,7 N left,10 N right,D,Forces in same direction add → 3 + 7 = 10 N right.
5 N up and 5 N down act. Net force?,5 up,0,5 down,10,B,Equal and opposite → net force = 0.
