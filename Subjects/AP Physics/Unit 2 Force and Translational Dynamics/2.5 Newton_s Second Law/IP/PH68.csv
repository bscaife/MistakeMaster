Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does a constant net force cause?,No motion,Zero force,Constant velocity,Constant acceleration,D,"F = ma → constant force means constant *acceleration*, not constant speed."
"If net force is constant, what happens to velocity?",It stays the same,It depends on weight,It changes at a constant rate,It becomes zero,C,Constant acceleration means velocity increases steadily over time.
Why does a car speed up when a force is applied continuously?,Gravity pulls harder,Velocity is constant,Inertia pushes it,It’s accelerating constantly,D,"Net force produces constant acceleration, which increases velocity over time."
Which of the following is a misconception?,Acceleration = velocity change,Force = mass × acceleration,Constant force = constant speed,No net force = constant speed,C,"Constant net force causes increasing velocity, not constant velocity."
A rocket fires in space with constant thrust. What happens?,It stops,It accelerates constantly,It moves at constant speed,It slows down,B,Thrust is a constant net force → constant acceleration.
"If object starts from rest and has a constant force, how does velocity change?",It’s constant,It stays zero,It decreases,It increases steadily,D,Constant acceleration = velocity increases uniformly.
What is required for constant velocity?,Constant net force,Zero net force,Increasing force,High friction,B,Constant velocity requires balanced forces — net force = 0.
"F = 10 N, m = 2 kg. a = ?",10 m/s²,2 m/s²,0 m/s²,5 m/s²,D,a = F/m = 10 / 2 = 5 m/s².
"Object starts at 0 m/s, accelerates at 4 m/s² for 3 s. Final speed?",12 m/s,3 m/s,4 m/s,7 m/s,A,v = a·t = 4 × 3 = 12 m/s.
Force = 20 N on 5 kg object. Is speed constant?,Yes,"No, speed increases",Only if gravity acts,Only if balanced,B,a = 20/5 = 4 m/s² → object speeds up constantly.
