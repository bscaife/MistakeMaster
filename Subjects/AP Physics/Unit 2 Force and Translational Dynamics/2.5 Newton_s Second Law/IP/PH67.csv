Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does mass create a force by itself?,Only with velocity,"No, mass resists force — it doesn’t create it","Yes, mass pushes objects",Only for heavy things,B,"Mass is inertia — a measure of resistance, not something that causes force on its own."
What is the role of mass in Newton’s second law?,It resists acceleration,It increases friction,It causes force,It adds energy,A,Force must be applied to cause acceleration — mass determines how much acceleration results.
Why doesn’t a large object start moving by itself?,Friction always acts,Mass pulls it forward,It has energy,It has mass but no net force,D,"Without a force, even high mass objects do not move — mass alone doesn’t create motion."
Which quantity causes acceleration?,Mass,Inertia,Friction,Net force,D,F = ma → force produces acceleration. Mass resists it.
What is mass?,An energy value,A weight substitute,A force generator,A measure of inertia,D,Mass is a property that determines how much an object resists changes in motion.
Which statement is incorrect?,More mass = less acceleration,Mass creates force,Force causes acceleration,F = ma,B,Mass doesn’t create force — it determines how an object responds to it.
An object is massive but still. What’s true?,It generates motion,It needs a force to accelerate,It causes friction,It forces air away,B,Mass doesn’t cause motion — it responds to external forces.
Mass = 5 kg. No net force. Acceleration = ?,0 m/s²,5 m/s²,9.8 m/s²,1 m/s²,A,F = ma → a = F/m = 0/5 = 0 m/s².
"F = 20 N, m = 4 kg. a = ?",4 m/s²,5 m/s²,10 m/s²,0.2 m/s²,B,a = F/m = 20 / 4 = 5 m/s².
Object of mass m = 6 kg sits still. What’s net force?,6 N,0 N,12 N,9.8 N,B,No motion or acceleration → net force = 0.
