Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Two objects experience the same net force. Which accelerates more?,Depends on speed,The one with less mass,They accelerate equally,The heavier one,B,From F = ma → a = F/m → less mass = more acceleration.
What determines acceleration from a force?,Mass and force,Size of object,Weight alone,Friction only,A,Newton’s second law: a = F/m.
"If two blocks are pulled with 20 N, and one is twice the mass of the other, what happens?",Lighter one accelerates more,Heavier one goes faster,They go together,Heavier one accelerates more,A,Acceleration is inversely related to mass when force is constant.
Why doesn’t a truck accelerate more than a bicycle under the same force?,It has more energy,It has more mass,It is slower,It’s heavier,B,More mass resists acceleration — Newton’s second law.
"If mass increases and force stays the same, what happens to acceleration?",It becomes zero,It decreases,It stays constant,It increases,B,a = F/m → more mass = smaller acceleration for the same F.
Which object accelerates more under equal force?,The one with more weight,The stationary one,The bigger one,The one with less mass,D,Less mass = more acceleration if net force is the same.
"If net force = 10 N, which object accelerates more?",They are the same,10 kg object,1 kg object,Depends on direction,C,a = F/m → 10 N / 1 kg = 10 m/s² vs 10 N / 10 kg = 1 m/s².
F = 12 N. m = 3 kg. What is acceleration?,6 m/s²,12 m/s²,3 m/s²,4 m/s²,D,a = F/m = 12/3 = 4 m/s².
F = 12 N on 6 kg block. a = ?,2 m/s²,4 m/s²,6 m/s²,3 m/s²,A,a = 12 / 6 = 2 m/s².
Two blocks: 2 kg and 4 kg. F = 8 N. Which accelerates more?,2 kg block,Same,They don’t move,4 kg block,A,a = F/m → 8/2 = 4 m/s² vs 8/4 = 2 m/s².
