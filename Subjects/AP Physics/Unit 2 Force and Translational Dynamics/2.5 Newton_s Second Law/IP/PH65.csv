Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can forces be present if an object isn’t moving?,"No, force means motion","Yes, they may be balanced",Only if velocity is high,Only gravity acts,B,"Forces can exist and cancel out, resulting in zero net force and no motion."
What condition causes no motion despite forces acting?,Massless object,No gravity,Balanced forces,No friction,C,Forces that cancel (net = 0) produce no acceleration or motion.
A book sits on a desk. What forces act?,Only tension,Only friction,Gravity and normal force,No forces,C,Weight pulls down; the table pushes up — these cancel but still exist.
Why doesn't a block fall through the floor?,Friction pulls it upward,It has no mass,Normal force balances gravity,Gravity stops at floor,C,The table provides an upward force equal to the object’s weight.
"If net force is zero and object is at rest, what happens?",It stays at rest,It begins moving,It accelerates,It turns sideways,A,Newton’s first law — object remains at rest if net force = 0.
Which best shows that forces can act on a still object?,Flying projectile,Thrown ball,Hanging mass,Falling object,C,A hanging object experiences tension and gravity — both real forces.
Which of these situations involves forces but no motion?,A ladder leaning against a wall,A sliding box,A rope accelerating a crate,A balloon rising,A,"Ladder has normal, friction, and weight — they cancel."
Block at rest. Mass = 5 kg. Gravity force?,9.8 N,49 N,5 N,0,B,F = m·g = 5 × 9.8 = 49 N downward.
Friction = 10 N. Push = 10 N. Object stays still. Net force?,10 N,0 N,20 N,−10 N,B,Equal opposing forces → Fₙₑₜ = 0.
Object suspended by rope. Weight = 100 N. Tension = ?,200 N,0,100 N,50 N,C,"For equilibrium, tension = weight → 100 N."
