"A force F acts on an object of mass m, initially at rest. After time t, its velocity is v. Which expression must be true?",C,F = m / t,False,PH67,v = F / m,False,PH64,v = F·t / m,True,,v = m·F / t,False,PH70,"Start from F = m·a, and use a = ∆v / t → F = m·(v / t) → v = (F·t) / m."
Two carts of masses m and 2m are pushed with the same net force F. What is the ratio a₁ : a₂ of their accelerations?,A,2 : 1,True,,1 : 2,False,PH66,1 : 1,False,PH66,Dependent on velocity,False,PH67,"From F = m·a → a = F / m, so a₁ = F / m and a₂ = F / 2m → a₁ : a₂ = 2 : 1."
A moving object has a net force of zero. It continues at velocity v. Which equation is valid?,D,F = m·v,False,PH67,F = m·a and a = v,False,PH64,a = F / v,False,PH70,F = 0 → a = 0 → v = constant,True,,Newton’s First Law: Fₙₑₜ = 0 → a = 0 → object continues at constant velocity.
An object moves in a straight line and slows to a stop. Which must be true about its acceleration?,B,Acceleration is zero because the object stops.,False,PH65,Acceleration is opposite to its velocity.,True,,Acceleration increases as velocity decreases.,False,PH68,The net force must be zero while it moves.,False,PH64,"If velocity is decreasing, acceleration is in the opposite direction → net force is nonzero."
"An object of mass m is acted on by three forces: F₁ = 2N right, F₂ = 3N left, F₃ = 5N right. What is its acceleration?",C,a = (2 + 3 + 5) / m,False,PH70,a = 0 (forces cancel),False,PH64,a = (2 - 3 + 5) / m,True,,a = (5 - 3 - 2) / m,False,PH70,Fₙₑₜ = 2 - 3 + 5 = 4N → Fₙₑₜ = m·a → a = 4 / m.
An object pushed by a net force F experiences acceleration a. What happens to a if the mass is doubled?,A,a becomes half as large,True,,a stays the same,False,PH66,a doubles,False,PH66,a becomes zero,False,PH65,From F = m·a → a = F / m. Doubling m cuts a in half.
An object travels left while a rightward force is applied. What is the object’s acceleration?,D,"Zero, because motion and force are opposite.",False,PH69,"Leftward, because that’s the motion direction.",False,PH69,"None, because velocity opposes net force.",False,PH64,"Rightward, because net force determines acceleration.",True,,"Acceleration follows the direction of net force, not velocity → F = m·a."
