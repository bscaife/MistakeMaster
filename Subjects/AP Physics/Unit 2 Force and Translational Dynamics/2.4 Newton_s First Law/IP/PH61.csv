Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is inertia?,A force acting during motion,A property of mass resisting acceleration,An upward reaction,Friction-like pushback,B,Inertia is not a force — it’s an object’s tendency to resist change in motion.
Does inertia cause objects to move?,Only when falling,Only if they are heavy,"No, it resists changes in motion","Yes, it pushes them forward",C,Inertia resists acceleration but doesn’t apply force itself.
Which of the following is true about inertia?,It pulls upward,It cancels gravity,It is not a force,It creates velocity,C,Inertia is a passive property of mass — not a physical push.
Why does a passenger lurch forward in a car crash?,Inertia pushes them forward,They feel forward friction,Their weight pulls forward,Their inertia resists the car’s deceleration,D,Inertia causes them to continue moving while the car stops.
What resists changes in velocity?,Net force,Gravity,Tension,Inertia,D,Inertia is the tendency to maintain current motion.
How does mass relate to inertia?,More mass = more inertia,It cancels net force,Mass has no inertia,Inertia causes mass,A,Mass determines how much inertia an object has.
"If inertia were a force, what would be true?",Friction would increase,It would reverse velocity,Objects couldn’t rest,It would cause motion without interaction,D,Forces require interactions — inertia is not a push.
Object has mass = 3 kg. What is its inertia?,3 kg,9.8,0,Cannot be measured,A,Inertia = mass. No separate formula — it is the mass.
Which object has more inertia?,20 kg box,1 kg cart,5 kg ball,Equal for all,A,More mass = more inertia.
"If mass doubles, how does inertia change?",It stays the same,It doubles,It becomes zero,It halves,B,Inertia is directly proportional to mass.
