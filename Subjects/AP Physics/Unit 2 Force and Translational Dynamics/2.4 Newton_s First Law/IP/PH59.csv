Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can an object move without accelerating?,"No, motion means acceleration",Only at rest,"Yes, if velocity is constant",Only if net force acts,C,Objects moving at constant velocity have zero acceleration.
Which condition shows no acceleration?,Constant velocity,Changing speed,Turning corner,Falling,A,Acceleration means velocity changes — constant velocity means no acceleration.
What is required for acceleration to occur?,Large mass,Zero net force,Change in velocity,Presence of speed,C,Acceleration = change in speed or direction — not just motion.
Object glides with no friction. It moves 2 m/s forever. What is acceleration?,2,0,Depends on mass,9.8,B,Constant speed and direction = zero acceleration.
"If a = 0, what is possible?",Object slows down,Object cannot move,Object moves at constant velocity,Object turns,C,Zero acceleration means velocity doesn’t change — motion is still possible.
Which example has no acceleration?,A rock thrown up,A car cruising at constant speed,A car turning a corner,A ball falling,B,Only unchanging speed and direction = zero acceleration.
"If net force is zero, then:",Weight disappears,Acceleration is zero,Motion is impossible,Object stops,B,"Fₙₑₜ = 0 → a = 0, per Newton’s second law."
Object moves 4 m/s for 6 seconds. Acceleration?,9.8 m/s²,4 m/s²,0 m/s²,0.66 m/s²,C,Velocity is constant → acceleration = 0.
Car moves at 10 m/s. Fₙₑₜ = 0. What is a?,1,10,0,9.8,C,"No net force = no acceleration, even if it moves."
Runner moves at constant 3 m/s. What happens to speed?,Stays the same,Increases,Becomes zero,Decreases,A,Constant speed = no change → no acceleration.
