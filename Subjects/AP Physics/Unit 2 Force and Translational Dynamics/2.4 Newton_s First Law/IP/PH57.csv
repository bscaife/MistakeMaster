Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is true about an object in equilibrium?,"Net force is zero, but forces may be present",It is frictionless,Only gravity acts,No forces at all,A,Equilibrium means forces cancel out — it doesn’t mean no force exists.
A book sits on a table. What forces act?,Only tension,None,Only gravity,Gravity and normal force,D,Normal force from the table balances gravity downward.
Which condition describes static equilibrium?,Only contact force exists,ΣF = 0 and object at rest,Only weight acts,Acceleration = g,B,Equilibrium means net force = 0 and no acceleration.
An object moves at constant velocity. What can you say about net force?,It’s large,It equals speed,It is zero,It depends on direction,C,Constant velocity implies no net force (Newton’s 1st law).
Which force pair cancels in vertical equilibrium?,Friction and gravity,Friction and acceleration,Weight and normal,Normal and tension,C,Equal and opposite vertical forces cancel each other out.
A box is suspended from a rope. What’s true of its forces?,Only gravity acts,Friction holds it,Tension is larger,Tension and gravity are equal and opposite,D,No acceleration means forces are balanced.
"If F = 0, then:",Object must accelerate,Object must be still,Only gravity acts,Object may be at rest or moving at constant velocity,D,Zero net force can still involve motion — constant velocity.
Box mass = 6 kg. Normal force on horizontal floor?,6 N,58.8 N,0,9.8 N,B,Fₙ = m·g = 6 × 9.8 = 58.8 N.
"Tension = 120 N, gravity = 120 N. Net force?",0,120,9.8,240,A,Equal and opposite forces cancel → equilibrium.
Object slides at 5 m/s with no acceleration. Net force?,Greater than 0,5,0,9.8,C,No change in motion → Fₙₑₜ = 0.
