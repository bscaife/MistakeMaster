Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What happens when forces are balanced?,Acceleration increases,Object moves at constant velocity or stays at rest,Object must stop,Weight decreases,B,"Balanced forces mean net force = 0 → constant velocity or rest, but no change in motion."
Can an object move with balanced forces?,"Yes, at constant speed",Only in vacuum,"No, it must stop",Only if mass is large,A,Balanced forces can maintain motion — Newton’s 1st law.
Which scenario involves balanced forces?,Box sliding at steady speed,Car speeding up,Falling object,Pushed ball accelerating,A,Constant velocity → net force = 0.
Why doesn't a box stop on a frictionless surface?,No net force acts,It has no mass,Air keeps it going,Gravity reverses,A,No friction means no force slowing it → motion continues.
"If net force is zero, acceleration is:",0,9.8,Constant,Increases,A,"Newton’s second law: Fₙₑₜ = m·a → if Fₙₑₜ = 0, then a = 0."
What is true of an object with constant speed?,It has balanced forces,It’s speeding up,It must stop,It feels more gravity,A,Constant speed → net force = 0.
Can balanced forces exist while moving?,"No, motion ends",Only at equilibrium point,Only at rest,"Yes, if velocity is constant",D,Balanced forces mean no change in motion — but motion may still exist.
Object moves 10 m/s. Fₙₑₜ = 0. What happens?,It stops,It speeds up,It reverses,It keeps moving at 10 m/s,D,Zero net force = constant velocity — motion continues.
"Box slides at 5 m/s. Friction = 10 N, push = 10 N. Net force?",−10,5,0,10,C,Equal opposing forces → net force = 0.
Skater coasts without friction at v = 4 m/s. a = ?,0,9.8,−4,4,A,No force = no acceleration = constant motion.
