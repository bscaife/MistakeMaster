Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Do Newton’s third law forces cancel out?,Only if mass is equal,"Yes, always","No, because they act on different objects",Only in freefall,C,"Action–reaction forces are equal and opposite, but they act on different objects and don’t cancel each other."
You push a wall. Wall pushes back. Why don’t forces cancel?,Only one is real,They cancel by friction,They act on different systems,They are unequal,C,Forces must act on the same object to cancel — these act on separate objects.
Two skaters push off each other. Do their forces cancel?,"No, forces act on different people",Only if they are balanced,"Yes, so no motion",Only the lighter skater moves,A,"They each feel a force, but it acts on different masses — doesn’t cancel motion."
Why don’t Newton’s third law pairs result in zero net force?,Because friction reverses them,Because each force is on a different object,Because they’re unequal,Because time separates them,B,Net force applies to one object — not across systems.
What is true about interacting forces in third law pairs?,They combine with tension,They do not cancel because they act on different bodies,They are invisible,They are gravitational only,B,"Equal and opposite, yes — but acting on two objects = not canceling on one."
Which force pair does NOT cancel out?,Friction and push on same object,Upward and downward tension on rope,Gravity and normal on a box,"Earth pulls apple, apple pulls Earth",D,They act on different objects — Newton’s third law pairs do not cancel.
Why do action–reaction pairs not affect net force of a single object?,They vanish quickly,Because they are weak,Only big objects feel them,Each object’s net force depends only on forces *on* it,D,A net force is calculated per object — only forces *on* that object matter.
Skater A pushes B with 40 N. What is force on A?,0,20 N,40 N from B,80 N,C,Equal and opposite — 40 N from B on A.
Force = 30 N left on cart. Opposing 30 N on another cart. Net force on either?,Zero — total system,30 N on each,60 N,0 N — but forces on different objects,B,"Each object experiences 30 N, not canceling — forces act on different objects."
Block pushes wall with 60 N. Wall pushes back. Does block accelerate?,"Yes, due to reaction","No, forces are balanced *on the block*",Only if mass is small,Only if wall moves,B,Equal opposing forces on the block result in net force = 0.
