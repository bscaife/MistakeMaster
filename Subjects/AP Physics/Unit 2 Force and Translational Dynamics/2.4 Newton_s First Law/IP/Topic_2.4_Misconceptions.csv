Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH57,Objects in equilibrium have no forces on them,"Believes that if an object isn’t accelerating, no forces are acting on it — missing that forces can be balanced (net force = 0)."
PH58,Motion requires a net force,"Assumes that constant motion must be caused by a continuing force, misunderstanding Newton’s first law."
PH59,"If an object is moving, it must be accelerating","Equates motion with acceleration, failing to distinguish between constant velocity and changing velocity."
PH60,Balanced forces cause objects to stop,"Thinks that if forces are balanced, objects must be at rest, rather than possibly moving at constant velocity."
PH61,Inertia is a force,"Misinterprets inertia as a physical force that pushes back, rather than as a property of mass resisting acceleration."
PH62,"Forces cancel if they act in opposite directions, even on different objects","Confuses Newton’s third law pairs with internal balancing, thinking forces on different objects can cancel each other."
PH63,Objects naturally come to rest without a force,"Assumes stopping is natural unless something keeps pushing, missing the idea of inertia and neglecting friction."
