Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does Newton’s first law say about stopping motion?,Motion continues unless a force acts,Mass increases over time,Friction pushes objects,Motion stops naturally,A,Objects move at constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force — stopping isn’t automatic.
Why does a ball eventually stop rolling?,Its inertia runs out,Gravity pulls harder,It gets tired,Friction acts as a net force,D,"Without friction, it would keep moving — friction causes deceleration."
What happens to motion if there is no net force?,Object slows to a stop,Object speeds up,Object floats,Object continues moving at constant velocity,D,"In absence of net force, motion continues unchanged."
Which of the following requires a force to maintain motion?,None — motion continues unless opposed,Any object,Anything sliding,Only projectiles,A,"A force is only needed to change motion, not to sustain it."
What force slows a block on a table?,Normal,Friction,Inertia,Gravity,B,Friction resists motion and slows the object to a stop.
A puck slides on ice with no friction. What happens?,It reverses direction,It bounces,It slows down on its own,It keeps going at the same speed,D,"With no opposing force, velocity remains unchanged."
Which best shows misunderstanding of Newton’s first law?,Object accelerates from rest,Object slows because 'motion wears out',Object has no force,Object keeps going,B,Objects don’t stop on their own — they stop when acted on by a force like friction.
Object moving at 4 m/s has no net force. What happens?,It continues at 4 m/s,It stops,It slows down,It reverses,A,Zero net force = constant velocity.
Box moves across frictionless floor. Net force = 0. Acceleration?,4,1,9.8,0,D,a = F/m = 0 → acceleration = 0.
Ball rolls 10 m then stops. Why?,Its energy wore out,Friction acts against it,It wanted to,Gravity stopped it,B,Friction is the resisting force responsible for stopping.
