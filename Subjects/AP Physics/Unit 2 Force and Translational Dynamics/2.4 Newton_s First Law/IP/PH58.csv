Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does Newton’s first law say about constant motion?,Only gravity acts,A continuous force is required,Acceleration must happen,No net force is needed,D,Objects in motion stay in motion at constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.
"If an object moves at constant speed, what is the net force?",Zero,9.8 N,Proportional to distance,Equal to motion,A,Constant velocity = no net force acting (Newton’s first law).
Why does a ball rolling on ice stay in motion?,There is no net force slowing it,It’s gaining energy,The surface pushes harder,Friction is increasing,A,"Without a net external force, the ball keeps moving at constant speed."
Which situation shows zero net force but continued motion?,Falling object,Object being pushed harder,Object at rest,Object gliding on frictionless surface,D,Motion can continue without force if no resistance acts.
An object moves with zero acceleration. What must be true?,No net force,Zero motion,High speed,No mass,A,No acceleration means balanced forces (net = 0).
What is required to maintain constant velocity?,More mass,Constant net force,No net force,Increasing energy,C,Net force of zero is required to sustain motion — not increase it.
Why does a book continue sliding if pushed on a frictionless surface?,Weight increases,Only if mass is large,Air pushes it,No net force to stop it,D,"Without opposing forces, motion continues unchanged."
Box moves at 5 m/s on frictionless surface. Net force?,0 N,Depends on speed,5 N,10 N,A,Constant motion → net force = 0.
A cart rolls with v = 3 m/s and a = 0. What is net force?,3 N,1.5 N,0 N,9.8 N,C,Zero acceleration → zero net force.
"If net force = 0 and v = 4 m/s, what happens to speed?",Increases,Decreases,Becomes zero,Stays constant,D,No net force → velocity remains unchanged.
