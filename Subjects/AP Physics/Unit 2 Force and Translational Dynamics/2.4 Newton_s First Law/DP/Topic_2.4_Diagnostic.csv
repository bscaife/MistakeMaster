Question,Correct Answer,Choice A,Correct? A,Code A,Choice B,Correct? B,Code B,Choice C,Correct? C,Code C,Choice D,Correct? D,Code D,Explanation
A book slides at constant speed on a horizontal surface. What must be true?,B,It is accelerating.,False,PH59,The net force is zero.,True,,There is no friction.,False,PH60,The book has no weight.,False,PH57,Constant velocity → ∑F = 0 → a = 0. Forces are balanced.
What does Newton’s first law say about moving objects?,C,They always slow down.,False,PH63,They lose energy and stop.,False,PH60,They maintain motion unless acted on by a net force.,True,,They must be acted on continuously.,False,PH58,Inertia keeps motion constant in the absence of net force.
An object is at rest on a table. Which statement is true?,A,It experiences balanced vertical forces.,True,,It has zero weight.,False,PH57,It is accelerating upward.,False,PH59,It has no normal force.,False,PH59,Weight = normal force → net force = 0 → no acceleration.
A person pushes a box— but it doesn’t move. What force resists motion?,D,Gravity.,False,PH60,Normal force.,False,PH57,Weight.,False,PH60,Static friction.,True,,Static friction adjusts to prevent sliding if no net force acts.
An object has no net force acting on it. What is its acceleration?,C,9.8 m/s²,False,PH60,1 m/s²,False,PH59,0 m/s²,True,,It depends on mass.,False,PH57,Newton’s second law: ∑F = m·a → if ∑F = 0— then a = 0.
Why do objects in space continue to move without slowing?,A,There is no net external force acting.,True,,They are weightless.,False,PH59,Inertia doesn't apply.,False,PH63,Gravity pulls them faster.,False,PH60,In deep space— no net force → constant velocity.
Which is NOT an equilibrium situation?,D,Object moving at constant speed.,False,PH60,Object at rest.,False,PH59,Object floating steadily in water.,False,PH62,Object speeding up.,True,PH58,Speeding up → a ≠ 0 → ∑F ≠ 0 → not equilibrium.
A ball falls freely under gravity. What is its net force?,C,Zero.,False,PH57,Equal to normal force.,False,PH59,Equal to its weight.,True,,Negative.,False,PH62,Only gravity acts → net force = mg downward.
Why do students incorrectly assume friction always stops motion?,B,Because friction increases energy.,False,PH58,Because they confuse friction with net force.,True,,Because acceleration is always positive.,False,PH59,Because mass prevents equilibrium.,False,PH62,Friction resists motion— but motion can continue if balanced.
A block is in equilibrium. Which is necessarily true?,A,The net force on the block is zero.,True,,It must be stationary.,False,PH59,Its speed is increasing.,False,PH58,It is weightless.,False,PH57,Equilibrium = constant v or rest → ∑F = 0 always.
