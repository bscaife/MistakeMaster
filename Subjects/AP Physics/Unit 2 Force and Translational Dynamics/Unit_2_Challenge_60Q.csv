"Elevator A is moving upward at a constant speed of 4 m/s and Elevator B is moving downward at a constant speed of 2 m/s. In each elevator, a 10 kg object is on a scale. The scale in Elevator A reads F₍A₎ and the scale in Elevator B reads F₍B₎. Which of the following correctly compares F₍A₎ and F₍B₎, and provides a valid justification?",F₍A₎ > F₍B₎ because Elevator A is moving up while Elevator B is moving down.,F₍A₎ > F₍B₎ because Elevator A has a greater speed than Elevator B.,F₍A₎ = F₍B₎ because two objects with the same mass always have the same apparent weight.,F₍A₎ = F₍B₎ because both elevators are traveling with a constant speed.,D,"Since both elevators move at constant speed, the net acceleration is zero. According to Newton’s second law, with no acceleration, the net force is zero, so the normal force (scale reading) equals m·g in both elevators. Therefore, F₍A₎ = F₍B₎.",

"An astronaut in deep space is at rest relative to a nearby space station. The astronaut needs to return to the space station. A student makes the following claim: “The astronaut should position her feet pointing away from the space station. Then, she should repeatedly move her feet in the opposite direction to each other. This action will propel the astronaut toward the space station.” Is the student’s claim correct? Justify your selection.","Yes. The astronaut’s feet exert a force away from the space station, creating an equal and opposite force that will accelerate the astronaut toward the space station.","Yes. The astronaut’s feet will have a velocity that is transferred to her center of mass, accelerating the astronaut toward the space station.","No. The astronaut’s feet are not exerting a force on another object, so there is no external force to accelerate the astronaut toward the space station.","No. The astronaut would move away from the space station, not toward it, since her feet are pointed away from the space station.",C,"In space, internal movements like moving feet cannot create net acceleration without interaction with an external object. Newton’s third law requires a force on another object to produce propulsion; no external force means no change in motion.",

"Blocks m₁ and m₂ are on a surface with friction μₖ, connected by a rope. A force F pulls m₂. What is the net force on m₁?",F₍ₙₑₜ₎ = m₁·a + μₖ·(m₁ + m₂)·g,F₍ₙₑₜ₎ = m₁·a + μₖ·m₁·g,F₍ₙₑₜ₎ = m₁·a − μₖ·m₂·g,F₍ₙₑₜ₎ = F − μₖ·m₁·g,B,F₍ₙₑₜ₎ = m₁·a + friction = m₁·a + μₖ·m₁·g.,
A car of mass m rounds a frictionless banked curve of radius r at angle θ. What speed V keeps it on the curve?,V = √(g·r·sinθ),V = √(g·r·cosθ),V = √(r·g·tanθ),V = √(r·g⁄tanθ),C,Banking with no friction: tanθ = V² ⁄ (r·g) → V = √(r·g·tanθ).,
Block m₁ on an incline is connected to hanging block m₂. What is the acceleration a of the system? (No friction),a = (m₂·g − m₁·g·sinθ) ⁄ (m₁ + m₂),a = (m₁·g − m₂·g·sinθ) ⁄ (m₁ + m₂),a = (m₁·g·sinθ − m₂·g) ⁄ (m₁ − m₂),a = (m₁ + m₂)·g·sinθ,A,"Apply Newton’s 2nd to both masses, eliminate T, solve for a.",
A person of mass m stands on a scale in an elevator accelerating downward at rate a. What is the normal force Fₙ on the scale?,Fₙ = m·g,Fₙ = m·(g + a),Fₙ = m·(g − a),Fₙ = a ⁄ (m·g),C,Net: m·g − Fₙ = m·a → Fₙ = m·(g − a).,
