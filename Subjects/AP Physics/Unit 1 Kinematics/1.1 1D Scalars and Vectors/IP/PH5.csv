Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
An object is at rest. What can you conclude about its net force?,Net force must be positive,Net force must be negative,Net force must be zero,Net force is always upward,C,"If an object is at rest and stays at rest, the net force is zero per Newton’s first law."
Which equation represents Newton’s second law of motion?,𝐹 = m·a,𝑣 = d/t,𝐹 = Δp/Δt,KE = ½·m·v²,A,"𝐹 = m·a describes the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration."
"A box on a frictionless surface is pushed with 10 N and accelerates. If the force doubles, what happens to acceleration?",It is halved,It doubles,It stays the same,It becomes zero,B,a = 𝐹/m → doubling 𝐹 while mass stays constant means a doubles.
A car travels in a circle at constant speed. What is true about its acceleration?,There is no acceleration,Acceleration is outward,Acceleration is inward,Acceleration is vertical,C,Centripetal acceleration is directed inward toward the center of the circle.
"A student states: 'If velocity is negative, acceleration must also be negative.' Is this correct?","Yes, always","No, because acceleration could oppose velocity",Only if speed is constant,Only for falling objects,B,Acceleration and velocity may have opposite signs if the object is slowing down.
Which of the following is not required for a quantity to be a vector?,A magnitude,A direction,An arrow in a diagram,Units,C,"Vectors are defined by direction and magnitude, not visual arrows."
Which statement is true about displacement and velocity?,Displacement and velocity are scalars,Both are vectors,Only velocity is a vector,Neither require direction,B,"Displacement and velocity both include direction, making them vectors."
A ball is thrown up. What is its acceleration at the top of its motion?,0 m/s²,9.8 m/s² up,−9.8 m/s²,Depends on speed,C,Acceleration due to gravity is constant and downward (−9.8 m/s²) even at the top.
Which variable pair must have opposite signs for an object to slow down?,𝑣 and t,𝑣 and a,𝑎 and m,𝑎 and d,B,An object slows down when velocity and acceleration have opposite signs.
"If 𝐹₍ₙ₎ = 0, and 𝐹₍g₎ = 10 N, what can we say?",The object is weightless,The object is in free fall,The object is at rest,The object is accelerating upward,B,"If the normal force is zero but gravity acts, the object is freely falling."
