Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student claims 𝑣⃗ = 5 m/s is not a vector because it lacks an arrow in a diagram. Which statement best refutes this?,Arrows are needed to show any vector.,Only acceleration vectors require arrows.,"Vectors are defined by direction and magnitude, not symbols.",It depends on the type of vector.,C,"A quantity is a vector if it includes magnitude and direction, regardless of how it’s displayed."
Which of the following is a valid representation of a vector quantity?,𝑎⃗ = −9.8 m/s²,"Force of 10 N, no direction",Speed = 20 m/s,3.5 kg,A,A vector has both magnitude and direction; 𝑎⃗ = −9.8 m/s² meets this definition.
A student draws a free-body diagram but omits arrowheads. What does this mean for the forces shown?,They are no longer vectors.,They can’t be analyzed mathematically.,They are still vectors if direction and magnitude are known.,Only arrows define forces.,C,"Forces remain vectors if they retain both direction and magnitude, regardless of visual arrows."
"Which equation includes a vector quantity, even if not shown with arrows?",𝑣 = d/t,𝐹 = m·a,P = W/t,KE = ½·m·v²,B,"Both 𝐹 and 𝑎 are vector quantities in this equation, whether or not they’re marked with arrows."
An object has 𝑣 = −2.0 m/s. Which best describes this quantity?,It is not a vector without an arrow.,It is a scalar because it has no diagram.,It is a vector because of its negative direction.,Direction can only be shown graphically.,C,"A negative sign indicates direction, so 𝑣 = −2.0 m/s is still a vector even without a diagram."
Which of the following would not change the vector nature of a force?,Removing the arrow symbol,Removing direction,Converting it to magnitude only,Stating only the mass,A,Removing visual symbols doesn’t change its mathematical identity as a vector if direction is still known.
You are given: 𝑎₍ₓ₎ = −3 m/s². Which of the following is true?,It’s a scalar since it’s written as a component.,It’s a vector because it contains direction and units.,It’s not a vector without an arrow diagram.,Component form removes directionality.,B,Component vectors like 𝑎₍ₓ₎ are still vectors — they contain both magnitude and direction.
"Which expression shows a scalar, not a vector?",𝑣₍ᵧ₎ = 0,d = 3 m,𝑎⃗ = −9.8 m/s²,𝐹₍ₙ₎ = 12 N,B,d = 3 m is a scalar — no direction is given or implied.
In which case is a vector correctly identified without needing a drawing?,"𝑎 = 0.0 m/s², no diagram",Speed = 30 m/s,Energy = 400 J,Time = 2.0 s,A,"𝑎 = 0 is still a vector if understood to refer to directional acceleration, even without a diagram."
Which of the following justifies that velocity is a vector even when diagramless?,Velocity only becomes a vector when graphed.,Velocity includes time and position.,Velocity has direction and magnitude regardless of format.,Velocity depends on scalar displacement.,C,"Vectors like velocity are defined mathematically, not visually. Direction + magnitude = vector."
