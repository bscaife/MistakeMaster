Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A ball rolls east with a velocity of 2 m/s. Which of the following could describe a vector with the same magnitude but opposite direction?,2 m/s north,2 m/s west,−2 m/s² east,Speed of 2 m/s,B,A vector includes direction; “west” is the opposite direction to “east.”
A car’s velocity changes from 𝑣ᵢ = 4 m/s to 𝑣₍f₎ = −2 m/s in 3 s. What is the car’s average acceleration?,2 m/s²,−0.67 m/s²,−2 m/s²,−(2 m/s) / 3 s,C,a = (v₍f₎ − vᵢ) / t = (−2 − 4) / 3 = −6/3 = −2 m/s². Direction matters in velocity.
Two runners both finish a 100 m race in 10 s. Runner A ran east. Runner B ran west. Which of the following is true?,Their displacements are identical,They had equal speeds and velocities,"Their speeds were equal, but velocities were opposite",Their velocities were scalars,C,Speed = distance/time = same. Velocity includes direction = opposite.
Which of the following is a valid vector quantity?,3 m/s toward the left,10 kg,5 m,12 s,A,A vector has magnitude and direction; only A includes both.
A plane flies with a velocity of 𝑣⃗ = 250 m/s east. What is the resulting velocity if a wind of 40 m/s south acts perpendicular to the plane?,290 m/s,250 m/s,√(250² + 40²) m/s,40 m/s,C,Velocity is a vector. Combine components: √(v₁² + v₂²) = √(250² + 40²).
"If an object moves 3 m right, then 4 m up, what is its net displacement?",7 m,5 m,1 m,3 m + 4 m,B,Use Pythagorean theorem for vector sum: √(3² + 4²) = 5 m.
Which equation gives the scalar speed from a velocity vector 𝑣⃗ = −6 m/s?,−6 m/s,|𝑣⃗|,𝑣⃗²,0,B,Speed is the magnitude of velocity: |−6 m/s| = 6 m/s.
An object is moving in a circle at constant speed. Which statement is true about its velocity?,The velocity is constant,The velocity is zero,The direction of velocity is changing,Velocity is a scalar,C,"Velocity changes because direction changes, even if speed is constant."
"Given vectors 𝐴⃗ = 6 m east and 𝐵⃗ = 8 m north, what is the magnitude of their vector sum 𝐶⃗?",14 m,10 m,2 m,48 m,B,Use Pythagorean theorem: √(6² + 8²) = √(100) = 10 m.
Which expression correctly shows the difference between scalar and vector distance?,Displacement = total path length,Scalar = direction-sensitive,Speed = |velocity|,Distance includes direction,C,Speed is scalar (magnitude of velocity); it lacks direction.
