Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH1,Scalars and vectors are interchangeable,"Confuses directionless quantities like speed with directional ones like velocity, not recognizing that vectors require both magnitude and direction."
PH2,Vectors must always be shown with arrows,"Believes vector quantities are only vectors if physically represented by arrows, rather than recognizing it's the mathematical properties that define them."
PH3,Negative numbers always mean slowing down,"Interprets negative velocity or acceleration as implying a reduction in speed, ignoring that the sign simply indicates direction in 1D motion."
PH4,Distance and displacement are always equal,"Fails to recognize that distance is the total path length (scalar), while displacement is a net change in position (vector) that can be zero even with motion."
PH5,Speed and velocity mean the same thing,"Equates the scalar (speed) with the vector (velocity), overlooking the directional component that defines velocity."
PH6,Adding vectors is the same as adding numbers,"Ignores direction when combining vectors, especially in 1D problems involving opposite directions, leading to incorrect net quantities."
PH7,All motion must be in the positive direction,"Assumes negative motion isn't real or possible, misunderstanding that directionality is relative and depends on chosen coordinate system."
