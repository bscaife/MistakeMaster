Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"A student walks 3 m east, then 4 m west. What is their total distance and displacement?","Distance = 1 m, Displacement = 7 m","Distance = 7 m, Displacement = 1 m west","Distance = 1 m, Displacement = 1 m","Distance = 7 m, Displacement = 7 m",B,Distance adds all motion: 3 + 4 = 7 m. Displacement = net change = −1 m = 1 m west.
Which of the following quantities can be zero even if an object has moved?,Distance,Displacement,Time,Speed,B,Displacement = net change in position; it can be zero for round trips.
A car drives around a circular track and ends at the starting point. Which is true?,Displacement = circumference,"Displacement = 0, Distance ≠ 0","Distance = 0, Displacement ≠ 0",Both distance and displacement are zero,B,"Ending where you start = displacement of 0, but distance is total path length."
"If an object has 𝑥₀ = 0 m and 𝑥 = −2 m after 3 s, what is the displacement?",2 m,0 m,−2 m,5 m,C,Displacement = 𝑥 − 𝑥₀ = −2 − 0 = −2 m.
A student walks 2 m forward and 2 m back. What is their displacement?,4 m,0 m,2 m,−4 m,B,"Displacement is net change in position, which is 0 if the motion returns to start."
"A person walks 5 m north, then 12 m east. What is the displacement?",17 m,7 m,13 m,60 m,C,Use Pythagorean theorem: √(5² + 12²) = √169 = 13 m.
What distinguishes displacement from distance?,Displacement requires time,Distance is a vector,Displacement includes direction,Distance can be negative,C,Displacement is a vector and has direction. Distance is always positive and scalar.
A person jogs 800 m around a track and ends at the start. What is true?,Displacement = 800 m,Distance = 0,Displacement = 0,They didn’t move,C,Returning to the start gives a displacement of zero but distance = 800 m.
Which expression represents scalar total path length traveled?,d = |𝑥 − 𝑥₀|,Δ𝑥 = 𝑥 − 𝑥₀,distance = ∑ individual displacements,distance = 𝑣·t,C,Distance adds the magnitudes of each leg of the path; direction doesn’t matter.
"If 𝑥₀ = 10 m and 𝑥 = 10 m, what can be said about displacement and distance?","Displacement = 0 m, Distance = 0 m","Displacement = 10 m, Distance = 0 m","Displacement = 0 m, Distance could be more",Both are unknown,C,"If start and end positions are equal, displacement = 0. But distance depends on the path."
