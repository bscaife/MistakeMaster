Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
An object has 𝑣 = −3 m/s and 𝑎 = −2 m/s². What is happening to its speed?,It is slowing down,It is speeding up,It is at rest,It is moving in two dimensions,B,"When velocity and acceleration have the same sign (both negative), the object is speeding up."
An object has 𝑣 = +5 m/s and 𝑎 = −2 m/s². What is true about its motion?,Speeding up in the positive direction,Slowing down in the positive direction,Speeding up in the negative direction,Slowing down in the negative direction,B,Opposite signs for velocity and acceleration mean the object is slowing down.
"A ball is thrown straight up. At its highest point, what is 𝑣ᵧ and 𝑎ᵧ?","𝑣ᵧ = 0, 𝑎ᵧ = 0","𝑣ᵧ = 0, 𝑎ᵧ = −9.8 m/s²","𝑣ᵧ = −9.8 m/s, 𝑎ᵧ = 0","𝑣ᵧ = −9.8 m/s, 𝑎ᵧ = −9.8 m/s²",B,"At the peak, velocity is 0 but acceleration remains negative due to gravity."
An object moves left (−𝑥) and slows down. Which must be true?,𝑣₍ₓ₎ < 0 and 𝑎₍ₓ₎ < 0,𝑣₍ₓ₎ < 0 and 𝑎₍ₓ₎ > 0,𝑣₍ₓ₎ > 0 and 𝑎₍ₓ₎ > 0,𝑣₍ₓ₎ > 0 and 𝑎₍ₓ₎ < 0,B,"If the object is slowing down while moving left, velocity is negative and acceleration is positive."
A runner has 𝑣 = −6 m/s and 𝑎 = +2 m/s². What is happening?,Runner is speeding up to the left,Runner is slowing down while moving left,Runner is stopped,Runner is speeding up to the right,B,Velocity and acceleration are opposite signs → object slows down.
"If 𝑎 = 0 but 𝑣 ≠ 0, what does this tell us?",The object is speeding up,The object is slowing down,The object moves at constant speed,The object is not moving,C,Zero acceleration and nonzero velocity → constant velocity motion.
Which situation describes an object speeding up?,"𝑣 = −4 m/s, 𝑎 = +2 m/s²","𝑣 = 0 m/s, 𝑎 = −3 m/s²","𝑣 = +2 m/s, 𝑎 = +2 m/s²","𝑣 = +5 m/s, 𝑎 = −5 m/s²",C,"When velocity and acceleration have the same sign, speed increases."
An object moves right (positive direction) and speeds up. Which is true?,𝑣 > 0 and 𝑎 > 0,𝑣 > 0 and 𝑎 < 0,𝑣 < 0 and 𝑎 > 0,𝑣 < 0 and 𝑎 < 0,A,Speeding up in the positive direction requires both velocity and acceleration positive.
An object is thrown downward with 𝑣ᵧ = −10 m/s and falls faster. What must 𝑎ᵧ be?,𝑎ᵧ = −9.8 m/s²,𝑎ᵧ = +9.8 m/s²,𝑎ᵧ = 0,𝑎ᵧ = +10 m/s²,A,Both velocity and acceleration downward = same sign → speeding up.
"If 𝑣 = −3 m/s and 𝑎 = 0, what will the object do?",Speed up in the negative direction,Slow down to a stop,Continue at constant speed,Change direction,C,"Acceleration of 0 means constant velocity, even if velocity is negative."
