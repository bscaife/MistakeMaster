Question,Correct Answer,Choice A,Correct? A,Code A,Choice B,Correct? B,Code B,Choice C,Correct? C,Code C,Choice D,Correct? D,Code D,Explanation
Which of the following is a scalar quantity?,D,Displacement,False,PH1,Velocity,False,PH1,Acceleration,False,PH1,Speed,True,,Scalars have magnitude only. From speed = |v|— speed is scalar because it lacks direction.
A rock starts at position xᵢ = +5 m and ends at x₍f₎ = −15 m. According to ∆x = x₍f₎ − xᵢ what is the displacement?,C,The displacement is +20 m because both numbers are 20 units apart.,False,PH4,The displacement is −10 m since the final position is negative.,False,PH6,The displacement is −20 m — which means the object moved left.,True,,The object did not move because it changed direction.,False,PH4,Using ∆x = x₍f₎ − xᵢ = −15 − (+5) = −20 m — the displacement is negative. This means the object moved in the negative x-direction.
A particle moves with velocity v = −4 m/s for 5 seconds. Which statement best describes its motion?,C,It travels 20 meters in the positive direction.,False,PH3,Its velocity becomes positive after 5 seconds.,False,PH7,It moves 20 meters in the negative direction.,True,,Its speed is negative— so it remains at rest.,False,PH5,Using v = ∆x ⁄ ∆t— rearranged as ∆x = v · t = (−4) · 5 = −20 m. The object moves 20 meters in the negative direction.
A student walks 50 m east— then 70 m west. What is the total displacement?,B,120 m,False,PH4,20 m west,True,,70 m,False,PH4,120 m west,False,PH6,Displacement is ∆x = x₍f₎ − xᵢ = −70 + 50 = −20 m = 20 m west. Distance would be 120 m.
Which best explains why speed is not a vector?,A,Speed has no direction— only magnitude.,True,,Speed and velocity are interchangeable.,False,PH5,Speed must be positive because it is a vector.,False,PH1,Speed only describes motion in 1D.,False,PH1,From speed = |v|— speed lacks direction and is scalar.
A cart travels from xᵢ = −3 m to x₍f₎ = +5 m. What is the displacement?,C,−8 m,False,PH6,0 m,False,PH4,+8 m,True,,3 m,False,PH6,Using ∆x = x₍f₎ − xᵢ = 5 − (−3) = 8 m. The cart moves right 8 meters.
Which of the following statements about velocity is correct?,D,Velocity is always positive.,False,PH5,Velocity and speed mean the same thing.,False,PH1,Velocity equals distance divided by time.,False,PH4,Velocity includes both speed and direction.,True,,Velocity is a vector: v = ∆x ⁄ ∆t. It has direction— unlike speed.
A car moves at −6 m/s for 3 seconds. What is its displacement?,B,18 m,False,PH6,−18 m,True,,3 m,False,PH6,The car is stopped.,False,PH3,Using ∆x = v · t = (−6) · 3 = −18 m. Displacement is negative because direction is leftward.
If two objects have equal speed but opposite velocity— what must be true?,C,They move the same direction.,False,PH5,They are both at rest.,False,PH3,They move equally fast in opposite directions.,True,,They have equal displacement.,False,PH4,Equal speed means equal magnitude of v— but sign indicates direction. So they move opposite ways at the same rate.
Which equation most directly defines average velocity?,A,v = ∆x ⁄ ∆t,True,,v = x₍f₎ + xᵢ,False,PH1,v = xᵢ − x₍f₎,False,PH6,v = speed ÷ direction,False,PH5,Average velocity is total displacement over time: v = ∆x ⁄ ∆t.
