"Two people are in a boat that is capable of a maximum speed of 5 km/hr in still water. The people wish to cross a river 1 km wide to a point directly across from their starting point. If the speed of the water in the river is 4 km/hr, what is the minimum time required for the crossing?",1⁄9 hr,1⁄5 hr,1⁄4 hr,1⁄3 hr,D,"To go directly across, the boat must aim upstream at an angle. The vertical component of speed is √(5² − 4²) = 3 km/hr. Time = distance⁄speed = 1⁄3 hr.",
"Objects 1, 2, and 3 move with velocities v, −v⁄3, and −2v, respectively, in the horizontal direction. Which of the following correctly compares speeds S₁, S₂, and S₃ of objects 1, 2, and 3 respectively?",S₁ > S₂ > S₃,S₁ > S₃ > S₂,S₃ > S₂ > S₁,S₃ > S₁ > S₂,D,"Speed is the magnitude of velocity: S₁ = |v|, S₂ = |−v⁄3| = v⁄3, S₃ = |−2v| = 2v. So S₃ > S₁ > S₂.",
A model rocket is launched vertically from the ground. The rocket is launched from rest and accelerates upward with acceleration a for a time t. The engine then shuts off and the rocket continues to move upward. Assume that the maximum height of the rocket is small compared to the radius of Earth. Which of the following is a correct expression that could be used to determine the maximum height above the ground reached by the rocket?,½·a·t²,(a²·t²)⁄(2g),½·a·t² + (a²·t²)⁄(2g),½·a·t² − (a²·t²)⁄(2g),C,First phase (powered): h₁ = ½·a·t². Velocity at engine cutoff: v = a·t. Second phase (free flight): h₂ = v²⁄(2g) = (a²·t²)⁄(2g). Total height: h = h₁ + h₂ = ½·a·t² + (a²·t²)⁄(2g).,
"A kitten sits in a lightweight basket near the edge of a table. A person accidentally knocks the basket off the table. As the kitten and basket fall, the kitten rolls, turns, kicks, and catches the basket in its claws. The basket lands on the floor with the kitten safely inside. If air resistance is negligible, what is the acceleration of the kitten-basket system while the kitten and basket are in midair?",The acceleration is directed downward with magnitude less than g because the basket is light.,The acceleration is directed downward with magnitude equal to g because the system is a projectile.,"The acceleration fluctuates because of the rolling, turning, and kicking motion of the kitten.",The acceleration cannot be determined without knowing how hard the basket is pushed.,B,"Ignoring air resistance, once in free fall, all objects accelerate downward at g regardless of mass or internal motion. The system is a projectile with acceleration equal to g.",
A person driving a car suddenly applies the brakes. The car takes 4 s to come to rest while traveling 20 m at constant acceleration. Can the speed of the car immediately before the brakes were applied be determined without first determining the car’s acceleration?,"Yes, by dividing the distance (20 m) by the time (4 s).","Yes, by determining the average speed while braking and doubling it.","No, because the acceleration is needed to use standard equations such as Δx = v₀·t + ½·a·t².","No, because the fundamental relationship that defines velocity contains acceleration.",B,"Since the car slows uniformly from v₀ to 0, the average speed is (v₀ + 0)⁄2 = v₀⁄2. So v₀ = 2·(Δx⁄t) = 2·(20⁄4) = 10 m/s. No need to compute a first.",
