Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does the slope of an x–t graph represent?,Area,Time,Acceleration,Velocity,D,"In a position–time graph, slope = velocity."
What does the slope of a v–t graph represent?,Displacement,Speed,Mass,Acceleration,D,"In a velocity–time graph, slope = acceleration."
Which graph has area equal to displacement?,Position–time,Force–time,Velocity–time,Acceleration–time,C,Area under a v–t graph gives displacement.
How can you tell if a graph represents motion?,Find units,Look for curves,Check the axes,Estimate height,C,You must read the graph axes to interpret what’s being plotted.
Two graphs look the same but have different axis labels. Are they the same?,Only if velocity is constant,"No, axis labels change meaning",Only if time is on x-axis,"Yes, shape is all that matters",B,"Graph meaning is determined by what is on the axes, not just the shape."
"If the y-axis is labeled velocity and the line is sloped, what does slope mean?",Speed,Acceleration,Displacement,Velocity,B,Slope of a v–t graph = acceleration. Axes must be checked!
Which graph could show increasing velocity?,x–t graph with negative slope,v–t graph with upward slope,x–t graph with flat slope,a–t graph with area = 0,B,Only a v–t graph with increasing slope indicates increasing velocity.
A v–t graph has constant velocity of 6 m/s for 4 s. What is displacement?,10 m,0 m,6 m,24 m,D,Displacement = area = 6 × 4 = 24 m.
A v–t graph slopes from 0 to 8 m/s over 2 s. What is acceleration?,16 m/s²,8 m/s²,2 m/s²,4 m/s²,D,a = Δv/Δt = 8/2 = 4 m/s².
"If x–t graph is curved upward, what happens to velocity?",It is zero,It increases,It decreases,It stays the same,B,Curved upward x–t graph means increasing velocity (slope is increasing).
