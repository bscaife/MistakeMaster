Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which of the following best describes motion without using equations?,A velocity–time graph,A mass reading,A force equation,A single number,A,"A v–t graph shows how velocity changes over time visually, without needing equations."
What does a curved x–t graph indicate?,Constant velocity,Zero displacement,Changing velocity,Constant position,C,Curvature in a position–time graph shows changing slope → acceleration.
Which representation shows instantaneous velocity?,Tangent to x–t graph,Area under v–t graph,Slope of v–t graph,Slope of a–t graph,A,The tangent slope to an x–t graph gives velocity at a single instant.
Which visual tool can show acceleration without equations?,Value of x only,Slope of a v–t graph,A flat x–t graph,Slope of x–t graph,B,The slope of a v–t graph shows acceleration without needing calculations.
What can a motion diagram (dot diagram) show?,Only force,Only time,Only position,Changes in velocity,D,Dot spacing shows speed and changes in speed visually.
Which of these conveys motion without equations?,Motion diagram,Calculator,Stopwatch,Timer,A,A motion diagram is a visual way to represent an object’s motion.
"In a motion diagram, increasing dot spacing shows:",Constant velocity,Acceleration,Rest,Oscillation,B,Increasing spacing between dots means increasing speed → acceleration.
A v–t graph shows constant velocity of 5 m/s for 6 s. What is displacement?,30 m,25 m,0 m,11 m,A,Displacement = area under v–t graph = 5 × 6 = 30 m.
