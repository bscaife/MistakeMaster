Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does the slope of a tangent to an x–t graph represent?,Position,Instantaneous velocity,Acceleration,Time,B,Slope of a tangent to a position–time graph gives instantaneous velocity.
What does the slope of a tangent to a v–t graph represent?,Instantaneous acceleration,Instantaneous position,Speed,Displacement,A,Slope of a velocity–time graph gives acceleration.
Why use tangent lines on graphs in physics?,To find instantaneous rates,To compare curves,To find area,To eliminate direction,A,Tangents are used to find instantaneous velocity and acceleration (rate of change).
"If an x–t graph is curved, how do you find velocity at a point?",Find tangent slope,Take average over whole time,Use curvature,Measure total area,A,The slope of a tangent line gives the velocity at a specific moment.
What is the meaning of a changing slope in a v–t graph?,Oscillation,Zero velocity,Changing acceleration,Flat motion,C,Changing slope in a v–t graph means changing acceleration.
When is tangent slope on an x–t graph zero?,At maximum velocity,At turning points,At max acceleration,Never,B,"At turning points, velocity is zero, so slope of x–t is zero."
What does a steep tangent line in an x–t graph mean?,High acceleration,Flat motion,Turning point,High speed,D,Steeper tangent = greater instantaneous velocity.
An x–t graph has a tangent with slope 3 m/s. What is velocity at that point?,0 m/s,9 m/s,1 m/s,3 m/s,D,Slope of position–time tangent gives instantaneous velocity.
Tangent to a v–t graph has slope 2 m/s². What is acceleration?,4 m/s,2 m/s²,6 m/s²,0 m/s²,B,Slope of v–t graph = acceleration.
"At the peak of motion, x–t graph flattens. What is tangent slope?",Infinity,0,1,9.8,B,"At the top of a curve, velocity = 0 → slope = 0."
