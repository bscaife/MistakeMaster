Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH15,Graphs always show position directly,"Confuses velocity or acceleration graphs with position graphs, assuming any curve represents the actual path of motion."
PH16,Steep graph means faster acceleration,"Assumes steeper position-time graphs indicate greater acceleration, rather than understanding slope represents velocity and curvature represents acceleration."
PH17,Flat velocity graph means object is stopped,"Interprets constant velocity graphs as indicating no motion, confusing flat lines with zero velocity instead of unchanging motion."
PH18,Graph area has no meaning,Does not realize that area under a velocity-time graph gives displacement and area under acceleration-time gives change in velocity.
PH19,Tangent slope is meaningless,"Fails to understand that instantaneous velocity and acceleration can be derived from the slope of tangent lines to position and velocity graphs, respectively."
PH20,Only equations can describe motion,Overlooks the power of graphical and diagrammatic representations for interpreting and predicting physical motion.
PH21,Graph axes donâ€™t matter,"Ignores what variables are on graph axes, leading to misinterpretation of graphs (e.g., thinking a v-t graph is a position-time graph)."
