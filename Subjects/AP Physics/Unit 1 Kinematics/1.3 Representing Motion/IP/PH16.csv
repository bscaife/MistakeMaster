Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"In an x–t graph, what does the steepness of the slope represent?",Displacement,Position,Acceleration,Velocity,D,"The slope of a position–time graph represents velocity, not acceleration."
A steeper line on an x–t graph means:,Greater velocity,Constant acceleration,Greater acceleration,Changing position,A,Steep slope on a position–time graph means higher speed (velocity).
What indicates acceleration on an x–t graph?,Flat horizontal line,Curved shape,Negative slope,Steep line,B,Curvature in a position–time graph means velocity is changing → acceleration.
An x–t graph is a straight line. What does this tell us about acceleration?,𝑎 is large,𝑎 = 0,𝑎 = 9.8,𝑎 increases,B,Straight line in position–time graph means constant velocity → 𝑎 = 0.
"If an x–t graph has a line getting steeper with time, what does this mean?",Object is at rest,Velocity is constant,Velocity is increasing,Acceleration is constant,C,Changing slope (becoming steeper) indicates increasing velocity.
What does curvature in an x–t graph represent?,Displacement,Zero speed,Acceleration,Velocity,C,Curved position–time graphs indicate changing velocity = acceleration.
Which type of motion gives a parabolic x–t graph?,Constant speed,Circular motion,Freefall only,Constant acceleration,D,Constant acceleration leads to a parabolic position–time graph.
An object moves from x = 0 to x = 20 m in 4 s. What is its average velocity?,0 m/s,4 m/s,5 m/s,10 m/s,C,v = Δx/Δt = 20/4 = 5 m/s.
A curved x–t graph shows velocity increasing from 0 to 6 m/s in 3 s. What is a?,3 m/s²,1.5 m/s²,6 m/s²,2 m/s²,D,a = Δv/Δt = 6/3 = 2 m/s².
An x–t graph shows a flat horizontal line. What is velocity?,Constant,Unknown,Increasing,0 m/s,D,No change in position over time = 0 velocity.
