Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A flat line on a v–t graph represents:,Zero motion,Acceleration,No displacement,Constant velocity,D,A flat velocity–time graph means unchanging (constant) velocity.
"If v–t graph is horizontal and above the x-axis, the object is:",Not moving,Moving at constant speed,Accelerating,Reversing direction,B,Positive constant velocity = motion in a constant direction.
What does a flat line on a v–t graph indicate about acceleration?,𝑎 = 9.8 m/s²,𝑎 = 0,𝑎 is increasing,𝑎 = constant,B,Flat v–t means velocity is not changing → acceleration is zero.
"If velocity stays constant, what is the object's position doing?",Decreasing quickly,Staying the same,Changing steadily,Oscillating,C,Constant velocity means position changes uniformly over time.
"If a v–t graph is a horizontal line at v = −3 m/s, the object is:",Not moving,Reversing,Moving left at constant speed,Slowing down,C,Velocity is constant and negative → steady leftward motion.
Which of the following graphs shows constant motion?,Flat x–t graph,Sloped a–t graph,Flat v–t graph,Curved x–t graph,C,Flat velocity–time graphs represent constant velocity.
"If 𝑎 = 0, and 𝑣 ≠ 0, what is happening?",Object speeds up,Object moves at constant velocity,Velocity is zero,Object is stopped,B,No acceleration → velocity stays constant (nonzero motion).
Velocity = 4 m/s for 5 s. How far does the object move?,9 m,4 m,5 m,20 m,D,x = v·t = 4 × 5 = 20 m.
Velocity = −2 m/s for 6 s. Displacement = ?,−12 m,12 m,0 m,−6 m,A,x = v·t = −2 × 6 = −12 m.
An object moves at constant v = 3 m/s. What is 𝑎?,3 m/s²,9.8 m/s²,1.5 m/s²,0 m/s²,D,Constant velocity means no change → 𝑎 = 0.
