Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does the area under a velocity–time graph represent?,Acceleration,Speed,Slope,Displacement,D,Area under a v–t graph gives displacement (Δx).
What does the area under an acceleration–time graph represent?,Displacement,Instantaneous speed,Slope of x–t graph,Change in velocity,D,a–t graph area gives Δv.
Why is graph area important in physics?,It represents accumulated quantities,It determines the object's shape,It defines direction only,It gives average slope,A,"Area under a curve accumulates a rate (e.g., velocity gives displacement)."
"If a v–t graph forms a triangle, what is displacement?",Maximum velocity,Area of triangle,Slope of line,Negative acceleration,B,Displacement = area = ½·base·height for a triangular section of v–t graph.
"If a–t graph is constant at 3 m/s² for 4 s, what is Δv?",12 m/s,7 m/s,0 m/s,3 m/s,A,Area = a·t = 3 × 4 = 12 m/s.
Area under an a–t graph gives:,Object mass,Total velocity,Displacement,Velocity change,D,Integration of acceleration over time yields Δv.
Why is area under v–t graph positive and negative?,Energy loss,Direction of motion,Mass changes,Force applied,B,Area sign reflects displacement direction.
A v–t graph has v = 5 m/s for 6 s. Displacement?,30 m,1.2 m,0 m,11 m,A,Displacement = area = 5 × 6 = 30 m.
A–t graph shows a = 2 m/s² for 5 s. What is Δv?,10 m/s,0 m/s,25 m/s,2 m/s,A,Δv = a·t = 2 × 5 = 10 m/s.
v–t graph shows triangle from 0 to 4 s with peak v = 8 m/s. Displacement?,32 m,8 m,16 m,4 m,C,Area = ½·base·height = ½·4·8 = 16 m.
