Which graph has slope equal to velocity?,C,Acceleration vs. time.,False,PH15,Velocity vs. time.,False,PH16,Position vs. time.,True,,Speed vs. time.,False,PH14,Slope of x vs. t gives velocity: v = ∆x / ∆t.
What does the area under a velocity-time graph represent?,D,Acceleration.,False,PH18,Slope of the graph.,False,PH15,Maximum speed.,False,PH14,Displacement.,True,,Area under v–t graph gives total displacement.
A velocity-time graph is a straight line sloping downward. What does this mean?,A,The object has constant negative acceleration.,True,,The object is stopped.,False,PH17,The object is speeding up.,False,PH19,The object is changing direction.,False,PH16,Slope of v–t = acceleration. Straight downward slope = constant a < 0.
An object’s x–t graph is curved upward. What’s true?,C,Velocity is constant.,False,PH17,Slope is zero.,False,PH16,Acceleration is positive.,True,,Velocity is decreasing.,False,PH19,Curved x–t graph = changing slope → a ≠ 0. If curve steepens— a > 0.
An object moves with velocity that increases by 2 m/s every second. Which graph matches this?,B,A flat x–t graph.,False,PH15,A curved x–t graph that gets steeper.,True,,A flat v–t graph.,False,PH19,A v–t graph that curves downward.,False,PH20,If velocity increases steadily— position graph curves upward more steeply over time.
An object has acceleration a = −2 m/s². What is the shape of its velocity-time graph?,A,A straight line with negative slope.,True,,A flat line above t-axis.,False,PH19,A parabola.,False,PH18,A curve that flattens.,False,PH16,Constant a = straight line in v–t. Slope = −2.
Which graph quantity gives instantaneous velocity on an x–t graph?,C,Area under the curve.,False,PH18,Slope of the v–t graph.,False,PH15,Slope of the tangent line to x–t.,True,,Y-intercept of the graph.,False,PH20,Instantaneous velocity = slope of tangent to position graph.
An object speeds up in the negative direction. Which is true?,D,Velocity is positive and acceleration is negative.,False,PH20,Both v and a are positive.,False,PH19,v > 0 and a < 0.,False,PH20,v < 0 and a < 0.,True,,Speeding up = v and a same sign. Negative direction → both negative.
A student claims a flat v–t graph means object is stopped. What’s wrong?,B,The student is correct — flat means v = 0.,False,PH17,Velocity is constant ≠ 0— so object moves steadily.,True,,Flat v–t means slowing down.,False,PH16,Only a = 0 matters.,False,PH17,Flat v–t means constant v — could be nonzero.
A v–t graph shows velocity reaching zero and becoming negative. What’s happening?,C,The object is slowing and then stopping.,False,PH17,Object is at rest and then moving again.,False,PH19,Object is reversing direction.,True,,Object is in equilibrium.,False,PH20,v crosses zero → change in direction. a ≠ 0 implies continuous motion.
