Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is a resultant vector?,A perpendicular line,A chosen direction,A calculated sum of component vectors,A scalar total,C,"The resultant is determined by adding components, not by guesswork."
How do you find the resultant of two perpendicular vectors?,Choose the longest one,Subtract the smaller from larger,Add their magnitudes directly,Use Pythagorean theorem,D,Pythagorean theorem gives the magnitude of a 2D resultant.
Why is direction important in vector addition?,To cancel velocity,Because vectors are directional,To create acceleration,Because mass is involved,B,Vectors must be added using both magnitude and direction.
Two forces act at right angles. How is the net force found?,By vector addition,By subtracting mass,By averaging,By selecting the stronger one,A,Only vector addition (with direction) yields correct net force.
Which method gives the direction of a resultant vector?,Divide angles,Subtract magnitudes,Guess based on shape,Use tan⁻¹(opposite/adjacent),D,Inverse tangent gives the angle of resultant from components.
Resultant vectors can be found using:,Component addition and geometry,Graph guessing,Assuming balance,Choosing random values,A,"Resultants are calculated, not guessed or chosen arbitrarily."
"If a vector points diagonally, it comes from:",One large horizontal force,Rotation,Only acceleration,Two perpendicular components,D,Diagonal motion is from x and y combined.
"vₓ = 3 m/s, vᵧ = 4 m/s. Resultant speed?",4 m/s,5 m/s,6 m/s,7 m/s,B,v = √(3² + 4²) = 5 m/s.
"Vector A = 5 N right, B = 12 N up. Resultant force?",17 N,7 N,13 N,10 N,C,F = √(5² + 12²) = √169 = 13 N.
Two perpendicular forces: 6 N and 8 N. Resultant?,10 N,12 N,7 N,14 N,A,F = √(6² + 8²) = √100 = 10 N.
