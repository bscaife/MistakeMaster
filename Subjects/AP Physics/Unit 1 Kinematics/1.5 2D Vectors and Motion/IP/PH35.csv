Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What happens to vertical velocity during a projectile's flight?,It remains constant,It reverses direction,It becomes negative then zero,It equals horizontal speed,B,"vᵧ starts positive (up), becomes zero at the top, and then negative (downward)."
How does vᵧ at launch compare to vᵧ at landing (same height)?,Landing is always faster,One is zero,"Same magnitude, opposite direction",Same value exactly,C,"If a projectile lands at the same height, vᵧ final = −vᵧ initial."
Why are vertical velocities not the same at launch and landing?,Because of terminal velocity,Because of gravitational acceleration,Because of angle symmetry,Because of air friction,B,Gravity constantly changes vertical velocity direction and magnitude.
"If a projectile rises, what happens to vᵧ?",It increases,It stays constant,It reverses immediately,It decreases due to gravity,D,Gravity slows upward motion until vᵧ = 0.
How does horizontal velocity behave compared to vertical velocity?,It reverses direction,It drops to zero at the top,It stays constant while vᵧ changes,It accelerates upward,C,vₓ remains constant; vᵧ changes due to gravity.
Why is vertical velocity zero at the top of a projectile's path?,Because motion momentarily stops in y,Because motion ends,Because energy is lost,Because mass is maximum,A,The turning point occurs when vᵧ = 0 before reversing direction.
What is true about vertical velocity when object lands at launch height?,Final vᵧ = −initial vᵧ,Final vᵧ = 0,Final vᵧ = initial vᵧ,Final vᵧ is always upward,A,Velocity has the same magnitude but reversed sign.
vᵧ = 10 m/s up at launch. vᵧ at landing (same height)?,−10 m/s,5 m/s,0 m/s,10 m/s,A,Final vertical velocity = −initial when returning to same height.
"Projectile launched at 45°. If vᵧ = 7 m/s, vᵧ at same-height landing?",0 m/s,−7 m/s,7 m/s,−14 m/s,B,"vᵧ reverses direction; same magnitude, opposite sign."
Time to top = 2 s. a = −9.8 m/s². What is vᵧ at launch?,4.9 m/s,9.8 m/s,0 m/s,19.6 m/s,D,vᵧ = a·t = 9.8 × 2 = 19.6 m/s upward.
