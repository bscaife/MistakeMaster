Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is true about any 2D vector?,It has no direction,It cannot be analyzed,It can be split into perpendicular components,It cannot change,C,Vectors can always be broken into x and y components.
Why do we break vectors into components?,To reduce velocity,To make motion stop,To analyze motion separately in each direction,To add mass,C,Decomposing vectors helps us treat motion along x and y axes independently.
A projectile moves diagonally. What kind of motion is this?,Pure horizontal motion,2D motion with independent x and y components,Circular motion,Pure vertical motion,B,"Projectile motion is 2D: x = constant velocity, y = accelerated motion."
Which equation relates vector components?,v = vₓ + vᵧ,v = vₓ − vᵧ,v = vᵧ / vₓ,v = √(vₓ² + vᵧ²),D,Pythagorean theorem is used to combine perpendicular components.
What is true about x and y motions for projectiles?,They must cancel,They must be equal,They only apply when falling,They are independent,D,x and y components evolve independently under different rules.
Can vectors be added by components?,Only with friction,"Yes, add x and y separately","No, they must be multiplied",Only in 1D,B,Component-wise addition gives the total vector.
Breaking a vector into parts means:,Slowing it down,Splitting into x and y directions,Removing direction,Shortening it,B,Component analysis splits vectors into directional parts.
A 10 m/s vector points 37° above horizontal. What is vₓ?,0 m/s,10 m/s,6 m/s,8 m/s,D,vₓ = v·cos(37°) = 10·0.8 = 8 m/s.
A 5 m/s vector points vertically. What is vₓ?,5 m/s,1 m/s,2.5 m/s,0 m/s,D,All motion is vertical → horizontal component is zero.
"If vₓ = 6 m/s, vᵧ = 8 m/s, total velocity?",14 m/s,7 m/s,48 m/s,10 m/s,D,v = √(6² + 8²) = √100 = 10 m/s.
