A projectile is launched at speed v at angle θ. What is its initial vertical velocity component?,B,v · cos(θ),False,PH29,v · sin(θ),True,,v / sin(θ),False,PH33,v / cos(θ),False,PH33,vᵧ = v · sin(θ) is the correct decomposition for vertical motion.
An object is projected with v = 20 m/s at θ = 30°. What is total time of flight?,D,t = 20 / 9.8,False,PH35,t = 20 · sin(30°),False,PH33,t = 2 · 20 · cos(30°) / 9.8,False,PH33,t = 2 · v · sin(θ) / g,True,,Time of flight = 2 · vᵧ / g = 2 · v · sin(θ) / g.
A projectile reaches a max height H after time t. What is H in terms of a and t?,C,H = a / t,False,PH34,H = 2a · t,False,PH34,H = ½ · a · t²,True,,H = 2t / a,False,PH34,H = ½ · a · t² from kinematics. Use a = −g upward motion.
Given vₓ = 15 m/s— vᵧ = 20 m/s at launch— what is the projectile’s speed at launch?,A,v = √(vₓ² + vᵧ²),True,,v = vₓ + vᵧ,False,PH33,v = (vₓ + vᵧ) / 2,False,PH33,v = √(vₓ · vᵧ),False,PH33,Resultant speed from orthogonal components: Pythagorean theorem.
Which vector expression gives horizontal range R of a projectile (flat ground)?,C,R = v · cos(θ) / g,False,PH35,R = v² / (2 · g),False,PH33,R = v² · sin(2θ) / g,True,,R = v · sin(θ) · t,False,PH35,The horizontal range is R = v² · sin(2θ) / g when launched and landed at same height.
A projectile travels 60 m horizontally while falling 45 m vertically. What is total displacement?,D,105 m,False,PH34,60 m,False,PH34,45 m,False,PH33,√(60² + 45²),True,,Displacement = vector sum of components: √(x² + y²)
An object has velocity v at 45°. What is angle between v and vₓ component?,B,90°,False,PH29,45°,True,,0°,False,PH29,Cannot be determined,False,PH33,At 45°— horizontal and vertical components are equal. The angle from v to vₓ is θ.
An object launched horizontally from 20 m high lands 40 m away. What was its horizontal speed?,A,vₓ = 40 / √(2h / g),True,,vₓ = √(40² + 20²),False,PH33,vₓ = √(2gh),False,PH35,vₓ = 20 · g,False,PH35,Time to fall t = √(2h / g)— so vₓ = x / t = x / √(2h / g)
Why is vertical and horizontal motion independent in projectile motion?,C,Because gravity pulls in both directions.,False,PH30,Because velocity is constant.,False,PH35,Because forces act only vertically after launch.,True,,Because mass determines both.,False,PH30,Horizontal motion has no net force. Only gravity acts vertically.
What does symmetry in projectile motion mean?,B,The object lands at its max speed.,False,PH32,Time to rise equals time to fall.,True,,Horizontal speed increases then decreases.,False,PH34,Final vertical velocity is always zero.,False,PH31,Projectile motion is symmetric in vertical direction: ascent and descent match in time and speed.
