A person walks at 2 m/s east relative to a train moving 10 m/s east. What’s the speed relative to ground?,D,2 m/s,FALSE,PH22,10 m/s,FALSE,PH23,12 m/s,FALSE,PH24,12 m/s east,TRUE,,Relative velocity: v₍ground₎ = v₍train₎ + v₍walker rel train₎ = 10 + 2 = 12 m/s east.
Two observers measure different velocities for the same object. Why?,B,They used different masses.,FALSE,PH27,They are in different reference frames.,TRUE,,One observer is accelerating.,FALSE,PH25,The object’s motion is irregular.,FALSE,PH22,Velocity is frame-dependent. Inertial observers may disagree on velocity.
What’s true in all inertial frames?,C,Velocity is identical.,FALSE,PH23,Time is the same.,FALSE,PH26,Acceleration is the same.,TRUE,,Forces act differently.,FALSE,PH25,Acceleration is invariant across inertial frames — a = F/m holds universally.
A ball is thrown upwards in a moving train. It lands where it was thrown. Why?,A,It keeps horizontal velocity with the train.,TRUE,,Gravity inside the train is weaker.,FALSE,PH24,The floor moved to catch it.,FALSE,PH26,The ball stopped in the air.,FALSE,PH25,The ball shares the train’s velocity. It appears to fall straight down inside.
What is an inertial reference frame?,C,A frame where objects don’t move.,FALSE,PH23,Any frame fixed to the Earth.,FALSE,PH25,A frame not accelerating.,TRUE,,A rotating frame.,FALSE,PH23,Inertial frames have no acceleration → Newton’s laws apply cleanly.
Why can't you feel uniform motion?,B,Because the body blocks air motion.,FALSE,PH26,Because all parts of your body move at the same speed.,TRUE,,Because vision cancels motion.,FALSE,PH22,Because friction with the seat is strong.,FALSE,PH27,No relative motion between your body and the environment = no sensation.
A car moves at 30 m/s and another passes it at 35 m/s. What is the passing car's speed relative to the first?,A,5 m/s,TRUE,,65 m/s,FALSE,PH22,−5 m/s,FALSE,PH23,0 m/s,FALSE,PH24,Relative velocity: v₍rel₎ = 35 − 30 = 5 m/s.
Which condition violates inertial frame assumptions?,D,Moving at constant speed.,FALSE,PH23,Observing from a satellite.,FALSE,PH24,Being on a train moving in a straight line.,FALSE,PH23,Observing from a turning carousel.,TRUE,PH25,Non-inertial frames (like rotating systems) involve fictitious forces.
An object appears stationary in your frame. What’s true?,B,Its velocity is zero in all frames.,FALSE,PH23,Its velocity is zero relative to your frame.,TRUE,,It has no mass.,FALSE,PH27,It’s moving in reverse.,FALSE,PH23,Motion is relative. It could be moving in another frame.
Which is a correct reference frame statement?,C,Objects are always at rest in their own frame.,FALSE,PH26,Frames affect object’s mass.,FALSE,PH27,Motion is relative to the chosen frame.,TRUE,,All observers agree on speed.,FALSE,PH22,Reference frame determines all motion measurements.
