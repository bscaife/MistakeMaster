Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH22,Motion is the same in all reference frames,"Fails to realize that velocity depends on the observer’s frame of reference, leading to incorrect interpretations of relative motion."
PH23,All observers measure the same velocity,"Assumes velocities are absolute rather than relative to each observer’s motion, contradicting the principle of inertial reference frames."
PH24,Observers moving together see different motion,Does not understand that observers moving at the same velocity relative to the same object will record the same motion.
PH25,Acceleration changes between frames,"Incorrectly believes that an object’s acceleration is different for different observers, when it remains the same in all inertial frames."
PH26,Reference frames are physical objects,Treats a reference frame like a physical structure rather than a conceptual coordinate system from which motion is described.
PH27,Relative motion must involve physical contact,"Thinks relative motion can only exist if objects are touching or interacting, rather than recognizing it as a comparison of velocities."
PH28,Zero velocity in one frame means zero in all,"Fails to see that an object can be stationary in one frame but moving in another, depending on the observer’s own motion."
