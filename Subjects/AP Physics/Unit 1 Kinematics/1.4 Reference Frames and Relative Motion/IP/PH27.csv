Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is relative motion?,Gravitational attraction,Comparison of velocities between observers,Physical contact between objects,Frictional resistance,B,"Relative motion is defined by the difference in velocities, not contact."
Can relative motion occur without contact?,"Yes, by comparing velocities",Only if there is sound,Only during collisions,"No, objects must touch",A,"Relative motion is based on frame comparisons, no contact needed."
Two cars move in opposite directions. Are they in relative motion?,Not unless interacting,Only if tethered,Only if they crash,Yes,D,"Different velocities = relative motion, even with no interaction."
"If two objects pass each other without touching, do they have relative motion?","No, because no contact",Only if accelerating,Only if same mass,"Yes, based on velocity difference",D,Relative motion depends on velocity difference.
What determines whether motion is relative?,Observer’s frame,Friction,Contact force,Electric charge,A,"Motion is described relative to a chosen frame, not based on contact."
Two spacecraft drift side-by-side at 5 m/s. What is their relative motion?,None,Rotating,Accelerating toward each other,Only with docking,A,"If both have the same velocity, there is no relative motion."
Why is contact not required for relative motion?,Fields do the work,Masses match,Forces cancel out,"Velocities are compared, not positions",D,Relative motion = difference in velocity regardless of interaction.
"Car A = 20 m/s, Car B = 10 m/s opposite. Relative speed?",0 m/s,30 m/s,10 m/s,20 m/s,B,Relative speed = 20 + 10 = 30 m/s (opposite directions).
You walk at 3 m/s on a 2 m/s walkway in same direction. Relative to walkway?,0 m/s,3 m/s,5 m/s,1 m/s,D,Relative velocity = 3 − 2 = 1 m/s.
"Runner A: 6 m/s, Runner B: 6 m/s, same direction. Relative velocity?",12 m/s,0 m/s,6 m/s,−6 m/s,B,Equal velocity → no relative motion.
