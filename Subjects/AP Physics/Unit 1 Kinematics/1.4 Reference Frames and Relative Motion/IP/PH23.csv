Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which quantity depends on the observer’s motion?,Height,Time,Velocity,Mass,C,Velocity is relative — different observers may measure different values.
"Two observers watch a moving car. One is walking, one is standing still. What differs?",Their measurement of the car’s velocity,The car’s acceleration,The car’s weight,The passage of time,A,Relative motion means each observer may measure a different velocity.
A train moves at 10 m/s. A person walks forward at 2 m/s inside. What is their velocity to an observer outside?,10 m/s,12 m/s,8 m/s,2 m/s,B,From the ground: total velocity = 10 + 2 = 12 m/s.
Why do observers sometimes record different velocities?,Velocity is always constant,Their clocks are broken,They use different units,They are in different reference frames,D,Reference frames affect how motion is observed and measured.
A bike passes a stationary observer. What velocity does the observer measure?,Negative acceleration,Double the velocity,Zero,Bike’s full velocity,D,Stationary observer sees bike’s actual ground velocity.
You walk forward at 2 m/s in a 3 m/s moving walkway. What is velocity to a person on the ground?,3 m/s,5 m/s,1 m/s,2 m/s,B,Relative to Earth: v = 2 + 3 = 5 m/s.
Which statement is true about velocities in different frames?,They are undefined,They are always equal,They cancel out,They may be different,D,Relative velocity depends on observer’s own motion.
A car moves at 25 m/s. A person inside throws a ball forward at 5 m/s. Speed relative to ground?,5 m/s,20 m/s,25 m/s,30 m/s,D,Total velocity = 25 + 5 = 30 m/s.
Train A: 20 m/s. Train B in opposite direction: 15 m/s. Relative speed?,5 m/s,35 m/s,20 m/s,15 m/s,B,Relative speed = 20 + 15 = 35 m/s (opposite direction).
Runner A = 6 m/s. Runner B = 3 m/s same direction. Relative speed of B from A?,−3 m/s,3 m/s,9 m/s,6 m/s,A,v₍relative₎ = 3 − 6 = −3 m/s.
