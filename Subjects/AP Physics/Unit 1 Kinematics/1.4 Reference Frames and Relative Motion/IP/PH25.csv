Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"In classical mechanics, what stays the same for all inertial observers?",Velocity,Position,Acceleration,Speed,C,Acceleration is invariant across all inertial reference frames.
Two people observe the same object in free fall from different frames. What do they agree on?,Acceleration,Velocity,Displacement,Initial position,A,All observers in inertial frames measure the same acceleration.
A car brakes with constant acceleration. How does this look in two inertial frames?,"Same acceleration, different velocity",Different acceleration,No motion,Same velocity,A,Acceleration is the same; velocity and position may differ between frames.
Which quantity is frame-dependent?,Time interval,Mass,Velocity,Acceleration,C,Velocity depends on the observer; acceleration does not (in Newtonian physics).
"If an object accelerates at 3 m/s² in one frame, what does another inertial observer record?",It depends,3 m/s²,0 m/s²,−3 m/s²,B,Acceleration is consistent across all inertial reference frames.
What must be true for all observers in inertial frames?,They are at rest,They observe different masses,They agree on acceleration,They agree on velocity,C,Acceleration is invariant in Newtonian mechanics for inertial observers.
What stays the same between two moving observers watching an accelerating object?,Velocity,Acceleration,Initial position,Displacement,B,Only acceleration remains invariant.
A ball falls with 𝑎 = −9.8 m/s². What does a moving observer measure?,0,9.8 m/s²,−9.8 m/s²,Depends on velocity,C,All inertial observers record the same constant acceleration.
Object slows from 10 m/s to 0 in 5 s. What is 𝑎 seen by a runner going at 3 m/s?,Depends on direction,−2 m/s²,2 m/s²,0 m/s²,B,Acceleration = Δv/Δt = −2 m/s² in all inertial frames.
A car’s velocity changes by 8 m/s in 4 s. What is 𝑎 in any inertial frame?,4 m/s²,2 m/s²,1 m/s²,8 m/s²,B,Δv/Δt = 8/4 = 2 m/s²; frame doesn’t affect this value.
