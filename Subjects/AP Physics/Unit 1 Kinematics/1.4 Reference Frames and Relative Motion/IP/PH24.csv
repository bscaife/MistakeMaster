Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What do two observers moving at the same velocity observe?,No motion at all,Different positions,The same motion,Different time rates,C,Observers in the same inertial frame observe the same motion relative to themselves.
Two runners jog side by side. What do they measure about each other’s motion?,High relative velocity,Random acceleration,Zero relative velocity,Constant motion,C,"With equal speeds and direction, each sees the other as stationary."
"If two trains move at 15 m/s in the same direction, what is their relative velocity?",30 m/s,15 m/s,0 m/s,−15 m/s,C,Same speed and direction means zero relative velocity.
Observers sharing a reference frame must:,Accelerate the same,Agree on relative motion,Measure opposite directions,Have different clocks,B,Shared velocity = same frame = identical velocity measurements of external objects.
You’re walking at 2 m/s next to a friend also at 2 m/s. What is their motion relative to you?,They move forward,They are faster,They move backward,They appear at rest,D,No motion relative to each other when velocities match.
Two spaceships drift side-by-side at 2000 m/s. What do they see?,They spin,Each appears to zoom past,Each appears stationary,They accelerate forward,C,Relative motion is zero when both objects have same velocity.
"If observers move with the same velocity as an object, they see it as:",At rest,Speeding up,Moving backward,Slowing down,A,Relative velocity = 0 when velocities match.
Two people run side-by-side at 3 m/s. Relative velocity?,0 m/s,3 m/s,6 m/s,1.5 m/s,A,Relative velocity = 3 − 3 = 0 m/s.
Two trucks move 20 m/s east. What is their relative speed?,40 m/s,0 m/s,10 m/s,−20 m/s,B,v₍relative₎ = 20 − 20 = 0 m/s → they appear stationary to each other.
Train A = 15 m/s. Train B = 15 m/s in same direction. What does A see?,Train B appears still,Train B moves past,Train B moves opposite,Train B accelerates,A,Same speed and direction → no perceived motion.
