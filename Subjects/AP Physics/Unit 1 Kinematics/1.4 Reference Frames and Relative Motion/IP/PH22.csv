Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What determines velocity in physics?,Object’s size,Direction of force,Temperature,Observer’s reference frame,D,Velocity depends on the chosen frame of reference — different observers can measure different velocities.
A passenger throws a ball forward on a moving train. What does a stationary observer see?,Ball moves faster than train speed,Ball moves only backward,Ball moves at same speed as train,Ball is stationary,A,"To a stationary observer, total velocity = train + ball."
A car moves at 10 m/s. A person inside walks forward at 2 m/s. What is velocity relative to Earth?,8 m/s,10 m/s,12 m/s,2 m/s,C,Relative velocity = v₍car₎ + v₍walker₎ = 10 + 2 = 12 m/s.
"A boat moves east at 5 m/s, current moves west at 3 m/s. Net velocity?",0 m/s,8 m/s east,2 m/s east,5 m/s west,C,Net velocity = 5 − 3 = 2 m/s east.
Which scenario clearly depends on the reference frame?,Ball falling vertically,A spring stretching,A block on incline,Two trains passing each other,D,Relative velocity between moving objects depends on frame of reference.
What is true about velocity observed from different frames?,It is absolute,It becomes zero,It must match,It may differ,D,Different observers may record different velocities for the same object.
"In physics, reference frames are used to:",Fix time units,Define motion relative to an observer,Find absolute speed,Cancel out forces,B,Reference frames define how observers describe motion based on their position/speed.
Train A moves at 20 m/s. A person walks backward at 3 m/s inside. Velocity from ground?,3 m/s,20 m/s,17 m/s,23 m/s,C,v₍total₎ = 20 − 3 = 17 m/s.
Car 1: 15 m/s. Car 2 passes at 20 m/s. Relative speed of Car 2 from Car 1?,5 m/s,35 m/s,15 m/s,20 m/s,A,v₍relative₎ = 20 − 15 = 5 m/s.
Runner A = 6 m/s. Runner B = 2 m/s same direction. Relative velocity of B from A?,−4 m/s,4 m/s,8 m/s,0 m/s,A,Relative velocity = 2 − 6 = −4 m/s.
