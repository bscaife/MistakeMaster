Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is a reference frame in physics?,A box that holds objects,A force sensor,A lab bench,A coordinate system used to describe motion,D,A reference frame is not a physical object — it’s a conceptual framework for measurement.
What defines a reference frame?,Force acting on system,Observer’s position and motion,Temperature of space,Mass of the object,B,Reference frames are defined by the motion and location of the observer.
Which of the following is not a reference frame?,An equation,A drifting spaceship,A stationary street corner,The floor of a moving bus,A,"Equations are tools, not coordinate systems or perspectives of observation."
"If you observe from the ground, what is your reference frame?",Outer space,Gravity,Earth’s surface,The object,C,Your frame of reference is the ground beneath you (Earth’s surface).
Which best describes a reference frame?,A metal frame around motion sensors,A display board in lab,A perspective to measure motion,A graph of velocity,C,"It’s a perspective, not a physical structure."
An astronaut observes from a moving capsule. What is their reference frame?,The capsule walls,The capsule’s motion,Earth’s surface,The Sun’s orbit,B,The capsule’s velocity defines the astronaut’s frame of reference.
Why is a reference frame important?,To describe motion relative to something,To find mass,To apply friction,To launch objects,A,Motion is described relative to a chosen coordinate system — a reference frame.
A car moves 10 m/s relative to Earth. What’s velocity relative to a person in the car?,0 m/s,10 m/s,20 m/s,5 m/s,A,"Within the same frame (car), velocity of car is zero relative to passenger."
Two trains move side-by-side at 30 m/s. Observer in one sees other at:,60 m/s,30 m/s,0 m/s,15 m/s,C,Same velocity and direction → relative velocity = 0.
You run 3 m/s on a 3 m/s moving walkway. Velocity relative to walkway?,0 m/s,6 m/s,9 m/s,3 m/s,A,"Relative to walkway, you are stationary when your speed matches walkway."
