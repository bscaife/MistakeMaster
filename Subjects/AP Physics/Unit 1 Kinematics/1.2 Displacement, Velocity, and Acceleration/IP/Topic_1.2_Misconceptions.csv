Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH8,Displacement and distance are the same,"Confuses total ground covered (distance) with net change in position (displacement), especially in back-and-forth motion."
PH9,Velocity and acceleration always point in same direction,"Assumes acceleration must always point in the direction of velocity, not realizing it can oppose motion (e.g., deceleration)."
PH10,Acceleration means an object is speeding up,"Thinks acceleration always increases speed, ignoring that it can slow objects down if opposite to velocity."
PH11,Negative velocity means slowing down,Misinterprets sign of velocity as indicating speed change rather than direction along a coordinate axis.
PH12,Constant velocity implies acceleration,"Assumes any motion must include acceleration, even in cases of uniform motion with zero net force."
PH13,Object at rest has no acceleration,"Believes a stationary object cannot be accelerating, ignoring cases like turning points or initial conditions in freefall."
PH14,Speed and velocity graphs are identical,"Confuses speed (scalar) with velocity (vector), expecting identical graphs regardless of direction changes."
