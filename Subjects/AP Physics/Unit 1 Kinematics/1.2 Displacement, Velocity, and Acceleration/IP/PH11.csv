Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"If an object has 𝑣 = −5 m/s, what does the negative sign indicate?",It is at rest,Direction of motion,Decreasing mass,Slowing down,B,"Negative velocity indicates direction along a chosen axis, not a change in speed."
Which velocity indicates motion to the left?,𝑣 = 0,𝑣 = +3 m/s,𝑣 = 3 m/s²,𝑣 = −3 m/s,D,"In 1D motion, negative velocity commonly means leftward motion."
"An object moves right, then reverses left. What changes sign?",Time,Mass,Distance,Velocity,D,Reversal of motion changes the sign of velocity (a vector).
"If 𝑣 < 0 and 𝑎 < 0, what happens?",Object speeds up left,Object is stationary,Speed is zero,Object slows down,A,Same sign for velocity and acceleration = speeding up (in negative direction).
Which of the following is a valid interpretation of 𝑣 = −8 m/s?,Object is moving left at 8 m/s,Object is accelerating,Object is turning,Object is slowing down,A,Negative velocity means motion to the left (if left is defined negative).
An object has negative velocity and zero acceleration. What happens?,It turns around,It slows down,It moves left at constant speed,It accelerates right,C,Zero acceleration = constant velocity → continues in negative direction.
Which scenario represents speeding up in the negative direction?,"𝑣 = 0, 𝑎 < 0","𝑣 > 0, 𝑎 < 0","𝑣 > 0, 𝑎 > 0","𝑣 < 0, 𝑎 < 0",D,"Same sign 𝑣 and 𝑎 = speeding up, even if direction is negative."
An object moves at −6 m/s for 4 s. What is its displacement?,6 m,−24 m,24 m,0 m,B,x = v·t = −6·4 = −24 m → motion is leftward.
A ball rolls at −2 m/s for 10 s. How far does it travel?,−20 m,2 m,20 m,0 m,C,Distance = speed × time = |−2| × 10 = 20 m.
"An object has 𝑣 = −4 m/s, 𝑎 = −2 m/s². What happens to its speed?",It decreases,It increases,It becomes zero,It stays constant,B,"Same sign = speeding up, though in the negative direction."
