Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
An object is moving right but slowing down. Which is true?,"𝑣 > 0, 𝑎 < 0","𝑣 < 0, 𝑎 > 0","𝑣 > 0, 𝑎 > 0","𝑣 < 0, 𝑎 < 0",A,"Slowing down in the positive direction means velocity is positive, acceleration is negative."
A car is speeding up while moving left. Which is true?,"𝑣 < 0, 𝑎 < 0","𝑣 < 0, 𝑎 > 0","𝑣 > 0, 𝑎 < 0","𝑣 > 0, 𝑎 > 0",A,Speeding up to the left: both velocity and acceleration are negative.
Which condition shows deceleration in the negative direction?,"𝑣 < 0, 𝑎 < 0","𝑣 > 0, 𝑎 > 0","𝑣 > 0, 𝑎 < 0","𝑣 < 0, 𝑎 > 0",D,Velocity and acceleration in opposite directions = slowing down.
"If 𝑣 = 0 and 𝑎 ≠ 0, what is happening?",Motion is impossible,The object is turning,The object is starting to move,The object is slowing down,C,Velocity = 0 but acceleration ≠ 0 implies starting motion from rest.
When is acceleration opposite in direction to velocity?,Object moves at constant speed,Object is speeding up,Object is at rest,Object is slowing down,D,Acceleration and velocity are opposite when the object slows down.
Which pair represents an object speeding up?,"𝑣 = −4 m/s, 𝑎 = −2 m/s²","𝑣 = −3 m/s, 𝑎 = +2 m/s²","𝑣 = +3 m/s, 𝑎 = −2 m/s²","𝑣 = 0, 𝑎 = 0",A,Same sign for velocity and acceleration = speeding up.
"If acceleration is perpendicular to velocity, what kind of motion results?",Stopping,Circular,Constant velocity,Slowing down,B,Perpendicular acceleration causes circular (centripetal) motion.
An object moves at 10 m/s and slows to 0 m/s in 5 s. What is acceleration?,2 m/s²,−2 m/s²,0 m/s²,−0.5 m/s²,B,a = (0 − 10)/5 = −2 m/s². Acceleration is opposite velocity.
A ball thrown up has velocity 0 at the peak. What is acceleration there?,0 m/s²,Depends on mass,−9.8 m/s²,9.8 m/s²,C,Acceleration due to gravity is always downward: −9.8 m/s².
A runner slows from 8 m/s to 2 m/s in 3 s. What is 𝑎?,−2 m/s²,2 m/s²,−6 m/s²,−3 m/s²,A,a = (2 − 8)/3 = −2 m/s² → opposite of motion = slowing down.
