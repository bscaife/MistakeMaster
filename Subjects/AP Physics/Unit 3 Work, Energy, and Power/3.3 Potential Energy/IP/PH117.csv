Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation,Code A,Code B,Code C,Code D
"If an object’s gravitational potential energy is zero, what can still be true?",It has no energy at all.,It cannot move anymore.,It can still have kinetic energy.,It has no mass.,C,"Even when Eₚ = 0, the object can still have kinetic energy: Eₖ = ½·m·v² — energy is not only potential.",PH117,PH117,,PH117
A rock hits the ground with speed. What is true at the moment just before impact?,It has zero energy because Eₚ = 0.,It has kinetic energy even if Eₚ = 0.,Energy disappears when it touches the ground.,Only potential energy exists at impact.,B,"At ground level, Eₚ = 0, but Eₖ = ½·m·v² is high — the object still has energy in motion.",PH117,,PH117,PH117
What does zero gravitational potential energy mean?,The object is out of energy.,The object cannot fall.,The object is moving too fast.,The object is at the reference height for Eₚ = 0.,D,"Zero Eₚ simply means the reference point (h = 0), not that the object lacks energy.",PH117,PH117,PH117,
A falling ball’s potential energy reaches zero. What happens to the rest of its energy?,It vanishes completely.,It becomes negative energy.,It turns into kinetic energy.,It becomes zero energy force.,C,"As potential energy (Eₚ) decreases, kinetic energy (Eₖ = ½·m·v²) increases — total energy is conserved.",PH117,PH117,,PH117
A rock is moving across the ground with no height change. What energy does it have?,Only potential energy.,No energy because Eₚ = 0.,Only mass-based energy.,Kinetic energy from motion.,D,Eₖ = ½·m·v² describes the energy of motion — the rock has energy even if Eₚ = 0.,PH117,PH117,PH117,
An object slides at constant speed along a flat surface. What is true about its energy?,It has no energy because it's not falling.,Its potential energy is high.,"It has kinetic energy, even if Eₚ = 0.",It has no mass so no energy.,C,Kinetic energy depends on speed: Eₖ = ½·m·v². Energy exists even with Eₚ = 0.,PH117,PH117,,PH117
"If a skateboarder is at the lowest point of a ramp, what’s true about their energy?",All their energy is lost.,They only have potential energy.,They only have energy if they are moving.,They can still have kinetic energy at Eₚ = 0.,D,"At the bottom (Eₚ = 0), the skateboarder may still have Eₖ = ½·m·v² from motion.",PH117,PH117,PH117,
A climber descends to base camp (height = 0). What is true of their energy?,They have no energy left.,They still have kinetic energy if moving.,Zero height means negative energy.,They only had energy while climbing.,B,"The climber may have no Eₚ, but Eₖ remains if there's motion — zero PE is not zero total energy.",PH117,,PH117,PH117
What can be true if potential energy is zero?,All energy is gone.,No forces are acting.,The object may still have kinetic energy.,The object must be at rest.,C,Kinetic energy (Eₖ = ½·m·v²) may still be present even if Eₚ = 0 — energy hasn’t disappeared.,PH117,PH117,,PH117
"If an object’s height is zero, what must be checked to determine if it has energy?",Whether it's in a vacuum.,Its color and shape.,Whether it’s moving (velocity).,If it’s above sea level.,C,Energy also depends on velocity. Eₖ = ½·m·v² shows motion gives energy even when Eₚ = 0.,PH117,PH117,,PH117
