Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH113,Potential energy is stored force,"Confuses energy with force, incorrectly thinking that energy is a physical push or pull."
PH114,Only stretched springs have potential energy,Fails to recognize that compressed springs also store elastic potential energy.
PH115,Potential energy is always positive,"Does not understand that potential energy can be defined as zero at a chosen point, and values can be negative."
PH116,Objects have gravitational energy only when falling,"Thinks gravitational potential energy only exists during motion, not based on relative position in a field."
PH117,Zero potential energy means no energy at all,"Believes that a zero PE implies the object has no energy, ignoring kinetic energy or other forms."
PH118,Potential energy is absolute,Misunderstands that the zero point for potential energy is arbitrary and can be chosen for convenience.
PH119,Two objects must be touching to have potential energy,"Overlooks that potential energy can exist due to fields acting at a distance, such as gravity or electrostatics."
