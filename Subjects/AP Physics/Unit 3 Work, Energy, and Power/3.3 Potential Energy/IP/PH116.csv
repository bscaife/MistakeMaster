Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A rock is held still 2 meters above ground. Does it have gravitational potential energy?,"No, because it’s not falling.","Yes, because of its height above ground.",Only when it starts to move.,Only if it has mass and velocity.,B,"U = m·g·h — object has GPE based on height above the reference point, regardless of motion."
Which factor affects gravitational potential energy?,Speed of the object.,Time it has been falling.,Height above the chosen zero point.,Color of the object.,C,"U = m·g·h — gravitational potential energy depends on vertical position, not motion."
When does an object stop having gravitational potential energy?,When it stops falling.,When it hits the ground and h = 0.,When its velocity is 0.,When air resistance is removed.,B,"U = m·g·h — when h = 0 (reference level), gravitational potential energy is 0."
A ball is at rest on a high shelf. What energy does it have?,"None, because it's not moving.",Kinetic energy only.,Gravitational potential energy only.,Thermal energy from rest.,C,"U = m·g·h — the ball has gravitational potential energy due to its height, not motion."
What is required for an object to have gravitational potential energy?,It must be falling.,It must have mass and be elevated above a reference point.,It must be accelerating.,It must be in motion.,B,"Gravitational potential energy depends on position (height), not velocity or motion."
An object is thrown and stops at the top of its path. What energy does it have then?,None — it's stopped.,Kinetic energy only.,Gravitational potential energy.,Only thermal energy.,C,"At maximum height, velocity is 0, so all energy is gravitational: U = m·g·h."
Gravitational potential energy depends on:,Speed and direction of travel.,Height relative to a reference level.,Total time falling.,The temperature of the surface.,B,"U = m·g·h — only height and mass matter, not motion or temperature."
Which object has gravitational potential energy?,A rock sitting on a cliff.,A rolling ball at ground level.,A block sliding horizontally.,A coin at rest on the floor.,A,U = m·g·h — height above the ground gives the rock potential energy even at rest.
A book is lifted but held motionless. What energy does it gain?,Kinetic only.,Thermal energy.,Gravitational potential energy.,No energy if it doesn’t fall.,C,U = m·g·h — lifting the book increases its height and GPE even if held still.
When is gravitational potential energy converted into kinetic energy?,As the object is falling.,While it sits at rest.,When it's on the ground.,At the peak of motion.,A,"As it falls, U = m·g·h decreases while KE = ½·m·v² increases — energy converts."
