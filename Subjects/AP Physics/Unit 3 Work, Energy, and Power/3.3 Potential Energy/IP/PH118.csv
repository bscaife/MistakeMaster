Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation,Code A,Code B,Code C,Code D
Which statement about gravitational potential energy is true?,It’s always zero at the Earth’s surface.,It’s fixed no matter where you are.,It depends on the reference height chosen.,It’s the same for all observers.,C,"Gravitational potential energy Eₚ = m·g·h depends on h, which is relative to a chosen zero level — it's not absolute.",PH118,PH118,,PH118
A student says Eₚ = 0 only when touching the ground. What's wrong with this?,Ground level always has positive energy.,Zero potential energy can be set anywhere.,Energy is measured from the sky down.,The formula doesn’t allow zero energy.,B,"Eₚ = 0 can be set anywhere — ground level, a shelf, or the bottom of a well. It’s an arbitrary reference.",PH118,,PH118,PH118
"If two students choose different zero levels for potential energy, what happens?",They get different physics results.,They must agree on one true zero.,They describe energy changes differently.,Only one answer is valid.,C,"Different reference points give different Eₚ values, but changes in energy (ΔE) remain consistent — physics stays valid.",PH118,PH118,,PH118
Why is potential energy considered relative?,It changes with seasons.,It depends on motion.,It depends on where you define h = 0.,It’s created by observers.,C,Potential energy is relative to a chosen zero height: Eₚ = m·g·h. Choosing a different h = 0 shifts Eₚ values.,PH118,PH118,,PH118
What happens to potential energy when the zero point is moved?,The energy becomes infinite.,It doesn’t affect energy values.,It shifts the Eₚ values by a constant.,It changes mass and gravity too.,C,"Changing the reference point shifts all Eₚ values by a constant amount, but doesn’t affect physical outcomes.",PH118,PH118,,PH118
"Why might one person say an object has Eₚ = 0, and another not?",They are using different reference heights.,Only one of them is using gravity.,The object moved in time.,Eₚ values should always match.,A,Potential energy depends on a chosen reference height. Different choices lead to different Eₚ = 0 locations.,,PH118,PH118,PH118
Can potential energy ever be negative?,"No, it must always be positive.",Only in outer space.,"Yes, depending on the chosen zero point.",Only if the object is upside down.,C,Potential energy can be negative if the object is below the chosen h = 0 point. It’s the difference that matters.,PH118,PH118,,PH118
Why is it okay to define Eₚ = 0 at the top of a ramp?,Because energy doesn’t matter there.,Because energy values are fixed.,Because the reference point is arbitrary.,Because gravity pulls upward there.,C,"We can define Eₚ = 0 anywhere for convenience — top of a ramp, floor, or bottom of motion path.",PH118,PH118,,PH118
Which choice shows potential energy depends on the frame of reference?,Two people measure different Eₚ but same ΔE.,Only one person sees gravity working.,They get different accelerations.,"One measures Eₚ, one doesn’t.",A,"Eₚ values depend on reference height, so different observers may assign different absolute values — but changes (ΔE) stay consistent.",,PH118,PH118,PH118
A climber starts halfway up a cliff. Where could Eₚ = 0 be?,Only at the ground.,Only at the cliff top.,Anywhere — it’s defined by the observer.,It must be where the climber starts.,C,Potential energy is relative; Eₚ = 0 can be set anywhere convenient to simplify the problem.,PH118,PH118,,PH118
