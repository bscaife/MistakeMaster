Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation,Code A,Code B,Code C,Code D
"Two objects are not in contact, but one has potential energy. Why is this possible?",Energy doesn’t need mass.,Fields can store energy over distance.,They must be connected by a string.,Only moving objects have energy.,B,Gravitational and electric potential energy exist due to fields — they do not require contact between objects.,PH119,,PH119,PH119
A satellite orbits Earth without touching it. Why does it have potential energy?,Because space is full of friction.,It stores energy from touching the atmosphere.,It’s within Earth’s gravitational field.,It pulls energy from the Sun.,C,"The satellite is in Earth's gravitational field, so it has gravitational potential energy: Eₚ = –G·M·m/r.",PH119,PH119,,PH119
Which example shows potential energy without contact?,A ball on a table touching the ground.,Two magnets separated by space.,A compressed spring between two blocks.,A ball bouncing off a wall.,B,Magnetic potential energy exists even when magnets don’t touch — it arises from fields.,PH119,,PH119,PH119
A book held in the air has potential energy because of what?,Its mass is increasing.,Gravity acts through a field over distance.,It is touching the air.,It wants to fall.,B,"Gravitational potential energy arises from the interaction with Earth’s gravitational field, not from contact.",PH119,,PH119,PH119
Why can a charged particle have electric potential energy when far from another charge?,It stores the field inside.,It’s moving closer on its own.,Fields allow interaction without touching.,Energy leaks through space.,C,Electric potential energy results from a field created by the other charge — no touching required.,PH119,PH119,,PH119
Which statement is true about gravitational potential energy?,It only exists during contact.,It depends on force during collision.,It exists due to the gravitational field.,It is stored in touching objects only.,C,Gravitational potential energy exists because of the field Earth produces — no contact is needed.,PH119,PH119,,PH119
A rock at the edge of a cliff has energy. Why doesn’t it need to touch the ground to have it?,Contact removes energy.,Touching makes it kinetic.,Its height gives it potential energy.,It only gains energy when falling.,C,Height in a gravitational field gives the rock Eₚ = m·g·h — no contact with the ground is necessary.,PH119,PH119,,PH119
What does it mean for two objects to have potential energy without touching?,They use air pressure.,They have stored energy from vibration.,They interact via a field at a distance.,They are about to collide.,C,"Potential energy can result from gravitational, electric, or magnetic fields — interaction happens over distance.",PH119,PH119,,PH119
Why can magnets separated in space still affect each other?,They send out sound waves.,Their magnetic fields reach across space.,The space between them contains force.,They release energy over time.,B,"Magnetic fields extend into space, allowing magnets to exert force and store potential energy without contact.",PH119,,PH119,PH119
A spring touches two objects. Why is that different from gravitational PE?,Gravitational energy also requires contact.,Springs store energy using compression.,Gravitational PE comes from a field at distance.,Springs don’t count as energy systems.,C,Gravitational potential energy is field-based (Eₚ = m·g·h); springs require contact and compression (Eₚ = ½·k·x²).,PH119,PH119,,PH119
