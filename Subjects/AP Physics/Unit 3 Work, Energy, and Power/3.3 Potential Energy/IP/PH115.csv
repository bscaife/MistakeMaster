Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says gravitational potential energy is always positive. What’s wrong with that?,Energy cannot be positive.,Only elastic potential energy is positive.,U can be negative depending on chosen zero point.,Energy is only positive in space.,C,"U = m·g·h — if h is below the zero point, U becomes negative."
An object 2 m below a reference point has what kind of potential energy?,Zero energy.,Positive energy.,Undefined energy.,Negative energy.,D,"U = m·g·h — h is negative below the reference, so U is negative."
Which situation shows negative potential energy?,A spring stretched 5 cm.,A ball at Earth's surface with U = 0 set in space.,A mass held above the ground.,A stationary object at equilibrium.,B,"If U = 0 at infinity, then U = –G·m₁·m₂/r is negative at Earth’s surface."
Where could an object have U = 0?,Only at Earth's surface.,Only in orbit.,"Anywhere, depending on chosen reference.",Only where F = 0.,C,Potential energy is relative — U = 0 can be chosen at any convenient height.
Why can gravitational U be negative near Earth?,Because force is pointing up.,Because h is negative from chosen origin.,Because mass is negative.,It can’t — U is always positive.,B,U = m·g·h — negative h yields negative U if origin is above the object.
"In the formula U = –G·m₁·m₂/r, what does the minus sign mean?",U is always positive.,U is zero at Earth’s surface.,U becomes negative as objects attract.,The negative sign is a typo.,C,Gravitational U becomes more negative as two masses get closer together.
What happens to U if a rock falls below the defined zero level?,It turns to kinetic energy and disappears.,It becomes undefined.,It becomes negative.,It resets to zero.,C,"U = m·g·h — if h < 0, U is negative relative to the zero level."
"If U is negative, what does that mean physically?",It’s unphysical.,The object is losing mass.,The zero was defined above the object.,Energy is being destroyed.,C,U = m·g·h — negative U simply means h is below chosen reference height.
Which graph could represent U vs. h for U = m·g·h with h = 0 set at 2 m?,A flat line above zero.,"A straight line through (0,0).",A line crossing zero at h = 2 m.,A constant negative value.,C,Setting U = 0 at h = 2 m shifts U = m·g·h to cross zero at that height.
How can you make U = 0 at the bottom of a well?,By measuring h from the bottom.,By resetting mass.,You can’t — U is always positive.,Set g = 0.,A,U = m·g·h — define h = 0 at the well’s bottom to make U = 0 there.
