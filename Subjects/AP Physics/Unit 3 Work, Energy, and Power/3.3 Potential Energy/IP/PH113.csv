Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which best describes potential energy in a stretched spring?,A force that is stored inside.,A stored ability to do work.,The spring’s motion.,The weight of the spring.,B,"Potential energy is scalar U = ½·k·x² — not a force, but energy stored due to displacement."
A stretched spring has potential energy. What else does it have?,Stored force that can be released.,"Potential to exert force, but not force itself.",Heat energy stored.,Gravitational energy only.,B,"U = ½·k·x² stores energy, while F = –k·x is the force it exerts — energy is not force."
What is the main difference between force and potential energy?,Force is stronger.,"Energy acts instantly, force takes time.","Force is a vector, energy is scalar.",There is no difference.,C,Force (F) has direction; energy (U = ½·k·x²) is a scalar representing stored ability to do work.
Which quantity describes a spring’s stored energy?,Its force constant k.,Its mass.,Its force at equilibrium.,½·k·x²,D,Elastic potential energy is U = ½·k·x² — it is not a force but a scalar quantity.
Why is potential energy not considered a force?,Because it’s invisible.,Because it doesn’t cause acceleration directly.,Because it is weaker than force.,Because it is always negative.,B,Potential energy is U = ½·k·x² — it does not cause acceleration directly like F = –k·x does.
Which situation shows energy stored but no net force?,A stretched spring held still.,A ball falling.,A sliding block.,A resting spring at equilibrium.,A,U = ½·k·x² exists even when object is stationary — energy is present without motion.
"When a spring is compressed and held still, what is true?",It contains a stored force.,"It stores energy, not force.",It pushes constantly regardless of x.,It loses all energy over time.,B,"Compression stores U = ½·k·x² — force exists, but energy is not the force itself."
How is spring force related to potential energy?,They are identical values.,Force is the rate of energy change with position.,Energy and force are both vectors.,Energy is constant while force varies.,B,F = –dU/dx — force is the derivative of potential energy; they’re related but not the same.
A student says energy is just invisible force. What’s wrong with this?,Energy causes motion directly.,Force is imaginary.,Energy is not a force; it’s a scalar that may result in force.,They are both the same.,C,Energy (U) is scalar; force (F) is vector and comes from gradient of energy.
What equation defines spring potential energy?,F = –k·x,U = m·g·h,U = ½·k·x²,F = m·a,C,"Elastic potential energy is U = ½·k·x² — energy stored, not force exerted."
