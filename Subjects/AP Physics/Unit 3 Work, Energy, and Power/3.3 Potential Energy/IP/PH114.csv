Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which spring stores more elastic potential energy?,One stretched 5 cm from equilibrium.,One compressed 5 cm from equilibrium.,One at equilibrium.,One stretched then released.,A,"U = ½·k·x² — both stretch and compression store energy, but stretched and compressed by same x yield equal U."
A spring is compressed instead of stretched. What happens to its potential energy?,It is zero unless stretched.,It becomes negative.,It still stores energy.,It only stores kinetic energy.,C,"U = ½·k·x² — compression gives positive x² just like stretching, so energy is stored."
Which spring has zero potential energy?,Compressed 3 cm,Stretched 3 cm,At equilibrium length,Released from compression,C,"U = ½·k·x² — x = 0 at equilibrium, so U = 0."
A spring compressed 10 cm stores how much energy compared to stretching 10 cm?,Less energy because it’s compressed.,More energy due to force direction.,Same energy as stretching.,No energy is stored when compressed.,C,U = ½·k·x² — same |x| gives same U whether compressed or stretched.
Which situation shows stored elastic potential energy?,A relaxed spring on a table.,A spring compressed in a toy car.,A spring dropped from a height.,A stretched spring released in air.,B,"U = ½·k·x² — compressed spring has nonzero x, so it stores energy."
A spring is compressed and held. Which best describes its energy?,Only kinetic energy exists.,Potential energy is zero.,It stores elastic potential energy.,Its energy depends on its mass.,C,U = ½·k·x² — compressed springs have potential energy just like stretched ones.
What happens to energy when a compressed spring is released?,All energy disappears.,Potential converts to kinetic energy.,Spring regains mass.,Spring gets cooler.,B,Elastic U = ½·k·x² converts to KE as spring moves toward equilibrium.
Why does a spring-loaded launcher work?,Stretched springs store heat.,Compressed springs store energy.,It has a heavy mass.,Springs gain velocity when held.,B,U = ½·k·x² — compression stores energy used to launch.
Two springs are compressed equally but have different spring constants. Which stores more energy?,The one with smaller k.,The one with larger k.,They store equal energy.,Neither stores energy when compressed.,B,U = ½·k·x² — greater k gives greater U for same x.
Which variable determines if a spring has stored potential energy?,Its total length.,Its compression or stretch distance x.,The direction of force.,The weight of the spring.,B,U = ½·k·x² — nonzero x (compression or stretch) creates potential energy.
