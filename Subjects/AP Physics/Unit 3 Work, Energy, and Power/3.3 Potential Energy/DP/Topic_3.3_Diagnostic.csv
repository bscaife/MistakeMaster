What is the gravitational potential energy of a mass m at height h above ground?,C,U = m / g,False,PH113,U = m · h,False,PH113,U = m · g · h,True,,U = g² / h,False,PH113,Gravitational PE = m·g·h relative to a chosen zero point.
If an object of mass m is dropped from height h— what is its speed just before impact (neglecting air resistance)?,B,v = m · g · h,False,PH113,v = √(2·g·h),True,,v = g / m,False,PH114,v = m / (g · h),False,PH113,PE lost = KE gained → mgh = ½·m·v² → solve for v
Which of the following defines potential energy conceptually?,D,Energy of motion,False,PH113,Energy conserved in collisions,False,PH115,Stored kinetic energy,False,PH113,Energy due to position or configuration,True,,PE is energy due to an object’s location in a field or system.
If an object is lifted to height 2h— how does its potential energy change?,A,It doubles.,True,,It quadruples.,False,PH114,It halves.,False,PH113,It stays the same.,False,PH114,U = m·g·h → double h = double U.
Two identical masses at different heights: h and 2h. Which has greater PE?,B,The one at h.,False,PH113,The one at 2h.,True,,They are equal.,False,PH113,It depends on kinetic energy.,False,PH115,PE increases linearly with height: U = m·g·h
What happens to mechanical energy in an ideal system (no friction)?,C,It disappears.,False,PH116,It becomes internal energy.,False,PH116,It is conserved.,True,,It is stored as mass.,False,PH113,Total ME = PE + KE remains constant in frictionless systems.
An object at rest slides down a frictionless ramp. What happens to its energy?,D,PE is lost and not recovered.,False,PH115,KE and PE both increase.,False,PH113,PE increases— KE decreases.,False,PH116,PE converts into KE— keeping total energy constant.,True,,PE transforms to KE while ME stays constant.
An object has PE = 200 J and KE = 300 J. What is its mechanical energy?,A,500 J,True,,100 J,False,PH116,600 J,False,PH113,Cannot be determined.,False,PH117,ME = PE + KE = 500 J.
Which expression gives height in terms of PE— m— and g?,B,h = PE · m · g,False,PH114,h = PE / (m · g),True,,h = m · g / PE,False,PH114,h = PE · g / m,False,PH114,From U = m·g·h → solve: h = U / (m·g)
Which statement about potential energy is FALSE?,D,It is relative to a chosen reference level.,False,,It can be converted into kinetic energy.,False,,It is stored energy.,False,,It is the same regardless of location.,True,PH118,PE depends on position and zero reference — not absolute.
