Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A car brakes and stops. Where does the kinetic energy go?,It disappears.,It turns into thermal energy from friction.,It becomes gravitational energy.,It becomes momentum.,B,Friction converts kinetic energy (½·m·v²) into thermal energy — it is no longer mechanical.
What happens to energy during a perfectly inelastic collision?,All energy becomes potential energy.,Kinetic energy is lost from the universe.,Some energy becomes thermal and sound.,Only potential energy remains.,C,"Some mechanical energy transforms into internal energy (heat, deformation, sound)."
A ball hits the ground and bounces lower. Why?,Gravity was stronger.,It lost energy to sound and deformation.,Kinetic energy increased.,Potential energy disappeared.,B,Mechanical energy is lost to non-mechanical forms like sound and internal vibrations.
Which process involves transformation of mechanical energy into non-mechanical forms?,Sliding a block on ice.,Dropping a ball in vacuum.,Block stopping on rough surface.,Spring oscillating in vacuum.,C,Friction causes mechanical energy to become thermal — it's not lost but transformed.
Where is mechanical energy not conserved?,Object sliding on a table with friction.,Ball tossed upward in vacuum.,Spring-mass in ideal conditions.,Pendulum in air with no drag.,A,"Friction transforms mechanical energy into thermal energy — total energy is conserved, but mechanical is not."
Why do real systems lose mechanical energy over time?,Mass increases.,Energy is destroyed.,Other forces transform it into heat and sound.,Gravity weakens.,C,"Non-mechanical forms like heat, sound, and internal vibration increase while mechanical energy decreases."
"When someone jumps and lands, where does the energy go?",It becomes thermal and sound energy.,It disappears.,It stays as kinetic energy.,It becomes gravitational energy.,A,Impact causes energy loss to heat and sound — it's not mechanical anymore.
A box slides to a stop on a carpet. What energy conversion occurred?,Kinetic to potential.,Kinetic to thermal.,Potential to mechanical.,Potential to momentum.,B,Friction converts KE into heat — mechanical energy becomes thermal.
Why is a swinging pendulum’s amplitude smaller over time?,Energy is being destroyed.,Mass is increasing.,Air resistance converts mechanical energy into heat.,Gravity gets weaker.,C,"Non-mechanical energy (thermal from drag) increases, reducing mechanical energy over time."
Which energy types exist after a bouncing ball stops?,Only kinetic.,Only gravitational.,Thermal and internal deformation energy.,None.,C,"After impact, motion ends but energy remains as heat, internal vibrations — non-mechanical forms."
