An object falls from height h. What is its speed just before impact assuming conservation of energy?,C,v = m · g · h,FALSE,PH120,v = 2gh,FALSE,PH120,v = √(2 · g · h),TRUE,,v = h / g,FALSE,PH120,PE → KE → mgh = ½·m·v² → solve for v.
Which principle ensures PE lost equals KE gained (ignoring friction)?,D,Work-energy theorem.,FALSE,PH124,Kinematic equations.,FALSE,PH125,Force conservation.,FALSE,PH124,Mechanical energy conservation.,TRUE,,In a conservative system— E = KE + PE remains constant.
An object slides down a ramp losing 300 J of potential energy. How much kinetic energy does it gain?,B,100 J,FALSE,PH121,300 J,TRUE,,Depends on mass.,FALSE,PH122,Zero.,FALSE,PH121,Energy is conserved → loss in PE = gain in KE.
Why does mechanical energy decrease in real systems?,A,Some energy converts to non-mechanical forms like heat or sound.,TRUE,,Because energy disappears.,FALSE,PH121,Because force is not conserved.,FALSE,PH120,Because potential energy is lost permanently.,FALSE,PH122,Friction and other non-conservative forces transform mechanical energy.
A spring launches a block from rest. What principle relates U = ½kx² to final KE?,C,Momentum conservation.,FALSE,PH124,Weight conservation.,FALSE,PH124,Conservation of mechanical energy.,TRUE,,Frictional loss.,FALSE,PH121,Elastic PE becomes KE → total mechanical energy is conserved.
A block slides up a ramp and stops at height h. How does its speed at bottom relate to h?,D,v = h / g,FALSE,PH120,v = g · h,FALSE,PH120,v = h / v,FALSE,PH120,v = √(2 · g · h),TRUE,,KE = PE → ½·m·v² = m·g·h → v = √(2gh)
If total mechanical energy is constant— what can you conclude about external forces?,A,They do no net work.,TRUE,,They increase internal energy.,FALSE,PH122,They cancel each other.,FALSE,PH121,They reverse direction.,FALSE,PH120,Only conservative forces → ∆Eₘₑcₕ = 0 → external work = 0
A 2 kg object moves with v = 5 m/s. How high could it rise if all KE becomes PE?,C,h = v,FALSE,PH120,h = m · g,FALSE,PH120,h = 1.28 m,TRUE,,h = √(2gh),FALSE,PH125,KE = PE → ½·m·v² = m·g·h → h = v² / (2g)
Which equation reflects conservation of mechanical energy?,B,½mv² = mgh,FALSE,PH120,½mv² + mgh = constant,TRUE,,KE = PE,FALSE,PH124,v = m · g,FALSE,PH125,Total mechanical energy = sum of KE and PE remains constant.
A falling object encounters air resistance. What happens to mechanical energy?,D,It stays constant.,FALSE,PH120,It increases.,FALSE,PH121,It becomes kinetic only.,FALSE,PH121,It decreases as some energy converts to heat.,TRUE,,Air resistance is a non-conservative force — mechanical energy drops.
