Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A roller coaster moves from high to low track. What happens to energy?,Potential energy is created.,Kinetic energy is destroyed.,Potential energy transforms into kinetic energy.,Energy disappears at the bottom.,C,"As height decreases, m·g·h (PE) is converted into ½·m·v² (KE) — total energy is conserved."
A ball is tossed upward. What happens to its energy at the top?,"Kinetic energy becomes zero, potential energy is maximum.",All energy disappears.,Potential is destroyed and kinetic created.,It has no energy at the top.,A,"At max height, v = 0 ⇒ KE = 0, but PE = m·g·h is maximum — total energy is conserved."
What happens when a falling object gains speed?,It loses energy.,Energy is created.,"Kinetic energy increases, potential decreases.",Potential and kinetic energy both increase.,C,Gravitational energy (m·g·h) transforms into kinetic energy (½·m·v²) — energy is not lost or created.
Why does a pendulum keep swinging in a frictionless environment?,Energy is continually created.,It loses potential energy each swing.,Kinetic energy disappears at the top.,Energy transforms between PE and KE.,D,The pendulum’s energy oscillates between KE and PE — total energy stays constant.
"When a block slides down a ramp, where does the potential energy go?",It becomes kinetic energy.,It is destroyed.,It disappears at the bottom.,It turns into mass.,A,"PE = m·g·h decreases while KE = ½·m·v² increases — energy changes form, not total amount."
What must be true for energy to be conserved?,Energy must remain as kinetic.,Energy must be created to balance losses.,"Energy can transform, but total remains constant.",Mass must also increase.,C,"Energy can shift between forms like KE and PE, but total energy remains the same in a closed system."
"If kinetic energy decreases, what might be happening?",Energy is disappearing.,Potential energy is increasing.,The object is gaining mass.,The system is creating heat.,B,"In absence of nonconservative forces, decrease in KE implies increase in PE to conserve total energy."
A student says energy is made when a spring is released. What's wrong with that?,Energy can’t change at all.,The spring destroys energy.,"Energy was stored as U = ½·k·x², not created.",Only mass creates energy.,C,"Stored elastic energy becomes kinetic — energy is transformed, not created."
"At the top of a hill, a skier stops. What type of energy does the skier have?","None, because they’re not moving.","Kinetic, from the climb.",Potential energy due to height.,Thermal energy from air.,C,"Even at rest, the skier has U = m·g·h from their elevated position — no KE but stored PE."
When does a moving object have no kinetic or potential energy?,"Never — energy transforms, not disappears.",Only when stopped.,Only at high speed.,When mass is zero.,A,"In a physical system, energy is not destroyed — it may change form, but total is conserved."
