Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A block slides across a rough surface and slows down. What happens to its mechanical energy?,It remains constant.,It increases.,It decreases due to friction.,It disappears entirely.,C,"Nonconservative force (friction) does work, reducing mechanical energy of the system."
When is energy conserved within a system?,"Always, no matter what.",Only when there is external work.,Only if there are no external or nonconservative forces.,Only if the system moves in a circle.,C,Energy is conserved only in isolated systems with no friction or external work.
A person pushes a box across the floor. What happens to the box’s system energy?,It increases due to external work.,It stays constant.,It is destroyed.,It becomes zero.,A,"External force adds work to the system, increasing total mechanical energy."
Friction is present in a system. What can you conclude?,Energy is added to the system.,Energy will be conserved.,"Some energy transforms into thermal, so mechanical energy decreases.",Friction increases potential energy.,C,Friction is nonconservative; mechanical energy is not conserved — it turns into heat.
A pendulum swings in a vacuum with no friction. What happens to its energy?,It increases every swing.,It is lost to the air.,Total mechanical energy is conserved.,Energy stops at the bottom.,C,"With no nonconservative forces, mechanical energy remains constant: KE + PE = constant."
Which condition guarantees mechanical energy conservation?,Any object moving.,No friction or external forces.,Presence of sound.,Mass stays the same.,B,Only isolated systems with conservative forces preserve total mechanical energy.
A skateboarder rolls uphill and stops. Why isn’t energy conserved?,"It is conserved, just changed forms.",Friction and air resistance dissipate mechanical energy.,Mass increased.,Energy was destroyed.,B,Friction and drag are nonconservative — they convert mechanical energy to thermal energy.
Why does total energy change in a system with external force?,System mass changes.,Friction prevents conservation.,"External force does work, adding energy.",Energy must become potential.,C,External work (like a push) changes the system's total energy.
"In a roller coaster with no friction, what happens to energy?",It is conserved: PE converts to KE and back.,It is lost after first drop.,It becomes internal mass energy.,It disappears at low points.,A,"With no friction, mechanical energy is conserved as it trades between KE and PE."
Which situation shows energy not conserved within the system?,Spring oscillating in vacuum.,Block on air track.,Object sliding with friction.,Ideal pendulum swinging.,C,Friction causes mechanical energy loss to heat — energy is not conserved within system.
