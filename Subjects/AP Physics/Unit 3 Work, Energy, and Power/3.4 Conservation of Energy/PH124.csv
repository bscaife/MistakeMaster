Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A passenger drops a ball inside a moving train. What does the passenger observe about the ball’s energy?,It has no kinetic energy.,It has energy only due to the train.,Its kinetic energy is zero in the passenger's frame.,Its kinetic energy is infinite.,C,"In the train’s frame, v = 0, so KE = ½·m·v² = 0 — energy depends on observer’s frame."
"Two observers watch a cart moving. One is at rest, the other moves with the cart. Who measures greater kinetic energy?",They measure the same energy.,The observer at rest measures more.,The one moving with the cart.,Neither — kinetic energy is invariant.,B,"Kinetic energy = ½·m·v² — the at-rest observer sees v ≠ 0, so KE is nonzero; moving observer sees v = 0."
Which quantity is frame-dependent?,Mass,Kinetic energy,Charge,Spring constant,B,"KE = ½·m·v² — depends on velocity, which changes with the observer’s frame."
Why can two observers disagree on an object’s total mechanical energy?,They disagree on mass.,They use different spring constants.,They see different velocities.,They use different units.,C,"Mechanical energy includes KE = ½·m·v² — v is frame-dependent, so energy is too."
A crate moves across a truck bed. How much kinetic energy does it have in the truck’s frame?,"Zero, if crate is stationary relative to truck.",Infinite.,Same as in ground frame.,Negative.,A,"If crate isn’t moving relative to truck, v = 0 in that frame, so KE = 0."
An object has KE = 100 J in one frame. What could it be in another frame?,100 J only.,Must be 0 J in all frames.,Could be 0 J or another value.,Always greater than 100 J.,C,"Kinetic energy depends on v, which is different in different frames — energy is not absolute."
What is true about potential energy in gravitational systems?,It’s the same in all frames.,It depends on velocity.,"It’s relative to chosen height, not frame.",It’s always zero.,C,"Gravitational PE = m·g·h is independent of observer motion, but depends on chosen reference height."
A runner moves at 4 m/s. A bicyclist next to them moves at 4 m/s. What is the runner’s KE in the biker’s frame?,Greater than in ground frame.,Zero.,Less than in ground frame but not zero.,Negative.,B,"In biker’s frame, relative velocity is 0 ⇒ KE = 0."
Why can mechanical energy appear different to different observers?,They use different equations.,They use different masses.,They see different velocities for the object.,Mechanical energy is not real.,C,"KE = ½·m·v² — velocity v changes by frame, so mechanical energy changes too."
What remains the same across all inertial frames?,Kinetic energy.,Velocity.,Mass and charge.,Total mechanical energy.,C,Mass and charge are frame-invariant — KE and velocity are not.
