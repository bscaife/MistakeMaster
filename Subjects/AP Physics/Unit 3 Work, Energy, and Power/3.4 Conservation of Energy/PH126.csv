Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A car moves at constant speed uphill. What happens to its energy?,It remains constant.,Only kinetic energy changes.,Potential energy increases while speed stays the same.,Kinetic energy turns into friction.,C,"KE = ½·m·v² is constant, but U = m·g·h increases as height increases — total mechanical energy changes."
Which situation shows changing energy at constant speed?,Ball rolling at same speed on flat ground.,Object in free fall.,Car driving up a ramp at steady speed.,Pendulum at bottom of swing.,C,"Constant v ⇒ constant KE, but increasing h ⇒ increasing PE, so total energy changes."
A person carries a backpack upstairs at constant pace. What's happening to energy?,KE increases continuously.,Total energy decreases.,Potential energy increases even though speed is constant.,Energy remains unchanged.,C,"KE is constant, but U = m·g·h increases as person gains height."
What can increase total energy without changing speed?,Increasing height.,Increasing mass only.,Changing direction.,Using more surface area.,A,Total energy = KE + PE — PE = m·g·h increases with height even if v is constant.
Why is speed alone not enough to determine energy change?,Speed determines energy fully.,Height or external work can change total energy.,Speed is the only variable in energy.,Mass cancels everything.,B,"KE depends on speed, but total energy also includes PE or external work."
A block slides down a ramp at constant speed. What must be true?,Total mechanical energy increases.,Friction is doing negative work.,Potential energy is constant.,Kinetic energy is increasing.,B,"As PE decreases, friction removes KE — energy is transformed, not conserved."
What can cause energy to increase even at constant v?,Friction.,Spring compression.,Climbing in height.,Constant direction.,C,"Speed unchanged ⇒ KE constant, but increased h ⇒ increased PE."
A cart rolls along a loop-the-loop at constant speed. What energy change might occur?,No energy changes at all.,Only potential energy changes with height.,Kinetic energy increases then vanishes.,Mass changes total energy.,B,"As the cart rises and falls, PE changes with height even if speed stays constant."
An object moves in a circle at constant speed. Is energy constant?,Yes — height and speed are constant.,No — speed changes.,No — KE always changes.,No — external force adds energy.,A,"If height and v are constant, then KE and PE are constant — energy remains unchanged."
Why might total energy change while KE stays constant?,Energy cannot change if speed is constant.,Changing PE due to changing height.,Kinetic energy becomes momentum.,Mass increases.,B,"KE = ½·m·v² constant, but PE = m·g·h varies with elevation — total energy can change."
