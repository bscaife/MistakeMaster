Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A ball falls freely. Is energy conserved?,"No, because net force is not zero.","Yes, total mechanical energy is conserved.",Only after it hits the ground.,Only if speed is constant.,B,"Though F ≠ 0 (gravity), energy converts from PE to KE — total mechanical energy is conserved."
Which situation involves energy conservation despite unbalanced forces?,A block moving at constant speed.,An object at rest.,A falling rock.,An object in equilibrium.,C,"Gravitational force causes acceleration, but energy still transforms and remains conserved."
An object speeds up downhill. Are forces balanced?,"Yes, always.","No, but energy is still conserved.","Yes, if friction is zero.","Yes, because acceleration is zero.",B,"Forces are unbalanced (net F down), but PE becomes KE — energy is conserved."
Why can energy be conserved during acceleration?,Because net force is zero.,Because no motion occurs.,Because force causes energy transfer.,Because acceleration cancels gravity.,C,"F·d = ΔE — even when F is unbalanced, work can transfer or transform energy."
A skater speeds up going down a ramp. Is mechanical energy conserved?,Only if velocity is constant.,Only if friction is present.,"Yes, even though net force is nonzero.","No, force must be zero.",C,"PE converts to KE — unbalanced F means acceleration, but total energy remains constant."
What does conservation of mechanical energy mean?,Net force must be zero.,"KE and PE may change, but their sum stays constant.",No energy is used.,The object must be stationary.,B,"Total mechanical energy stays constant when only conservative forces act, even with acceleration."
When are forces balanced but energy not conserved?,A block at rest.,Object moving at constant speed with friction.,Falling apple.,Mass on a spring.,B,Balanced forces (net F = 0) do not guarantee energy conservation — friction transforms energy to heat.
Can energy be conserved when forces do work?,"No, because forces add energy.","Yes, if the work is done by conservative forces.","No, because energy is destroyed.",Only if the object is not moving.,B,Conservative forces like gravity transform KE ⇄ PE without energy loss — energy conserved.
Which is a sign that forces are unbalanced?,Constant KE.,Acceleration present.,Balanced energy.,Height unchanged.,B,ΣF ≠ 0 ⇒ a ≠ 0 — acceleration shows unbalanced force but doesn’t prevent energy conservation.
An object in circular motion loses no energy. What does that suggest?,Forces are balanced.,Velocity is zero.,KE is constant; centripetal force doesn’t do work.,Force is zero.,C,Net F points perpendicular to motion ⇒ no work done ⇒ energy conserved despite unbalanced force.
