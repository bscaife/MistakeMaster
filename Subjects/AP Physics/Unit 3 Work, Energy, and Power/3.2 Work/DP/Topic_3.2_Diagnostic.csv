A force F moves an object through displacement d at angle θ. What is the work done?,C,W = F · d,FALSE,PH106,W = F · sin(θ),FALSE,PH106,W = F · d · cos(θ),TRUE,,W = F / d,FALSE,PH106,Work is scalar projection of force along displacement: W = Fd·cos(θ).
An object is lifted vertically at constant speed through height h. What is the work done?,A,W = m · g · h,TRUE,,W = 0,FALSE,PH107,W = h / (m · g),FALSE,PH107,W = m · h,FALSE,PH107,Work = force · displacement = mg·h
A block of mass m slides distance d on frictionless surface. If pushed by constant force F— what is final speed?,D,v = F / d,FALSE,PH110,v = √(F / m),FALSE,PH110,v = m · d,FALSE,PH110,v = √(2·F·d / m),TRUE,,Use W = ∆K → F·d = ½·m·v² → v = √(2Fd / m)
If net work done on an object is positive— what happens to its kinetic energy?,A,It increases.,TRUE,,It decreases.,FALSE,PH108,It becomes negative.,FALSE,PH108,It disappears.,FALSE,PH111,Work-energy theorem: W = ∆K → if W > 0— ∆K > 0
A box is pulled with 40 N at 60° to the horizontal for 5 m. What is the work done?,B,W = 200 J,FALSE,PH106,W = 100 J,TRUE,,W = 40·cos(60°),FALSE,PH106,W = 40·sin(60°),FALSE,PH106,Work = F·d·cos(θ) = 40·5·0.5 = 100 J
A student says more distance means more work even with zero force. What’s wrong?,C,They forgot acceleration.,FALSE,PH110,They ignored time.,FALSE,PH110,They ignored that work = 0 if F = 0.,TRUE,,They reversed cause and effect.,FALSE,PH112,W = F·d → if F = 0— then W = 0 regardless of d
If 150 J of work increases a 3 kg object’s speed— what is final speed from rest?,D,v = 5 m/s,FALSE,PH108,v = 100 m/s,FALSE,PH108,v = √(150 / 3),FALSE,PH108,v = 10 m/s,TRUE,,W = ∆K = ½·m·v² → solve for v.
What is the work-energy theorem?,A,Net work equals change in kinetic energy.,TRUE,,Work is always constant.,FALSE,PH108,Work depends only on distance.,FALSE,PH107,Kinetic energy is always conserved.,FALSE,PH110,W = ∆K — connects dynamics and energy.
An object slows due to friction. What is the sign of net work?,B,Positive— because it’s moving.,FALSE,PH108,Negative— because force opposes motion.,TRUE,,Zero— because speed changes.,FALSE,PH110,Undefined.,FALSE,PH110,Opposing forces → W = F·d·cos(180°) = negative
If applied force is perpendicular to displacement— what is work done?,C,Maximum,FALSE,PH106,Negative,FALSE,PH106,Zero,TRUE,,Infinite,FALSE,PH107,cos(90°) = 0 → W = F·d·cos(θ) = 0
