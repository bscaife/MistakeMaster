Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Do all forces do work on an object?,"No, only forces with a component in the direction of displacement do work","Yes, any force contributes to energy",Only horizontal forces count,Only contact forces count,A,Work = F·d·cosθ — forces perpendicular to motion (θ = 90°) do no work.
What is the work done by centripetal force in uniform circular motion?,Zero,Positive,Negative,Depends on radius,A,Centripetal force is always perpendicular to motion → cos(90°) = 0 → W = 0.
When does a force do no work?,When it is perpendicular to displacement,When it is upward,When speed is constant,When friction is present,A,Only components along displacement contribute to work.
Why does tension in a circular pendulum not do work?,Because it’s perpendicular to displacement,Because it cancels weight,Because tension is upward,Because the motion is circular,A,Perpendicular force → no energy transfer → no work.
Which of the following forces does no work on a moving object?,Centripetal force,Gravity in freefall,Friction on a slide,Push force on cart,A,Centripetal force keeps the object in circular motion but does not change its speed or energy.
A string keeps a ball moving in a horizontal circle. What is the work done by the string?,Zero,Positive,Negative,Maximum,A,Force is toward center; motion is tangential → W = 0.
Why is it incorrect to say all forces transfer energy?,Because only force components along displacement do work,Because friction is different,Because energy cancels,Because forces act at angles,A,Perpendicular forces don’t transfer energy.
"Force = 10 N, angle to displacement = 90°. d = 5 m. Work = ?",0 J,50 J,10 J,5 J,A,W = F·d·cosθ → cos(90°) = 0 → W = 0 J.
"Centripetal force = 12 N, circular speed = 3 m/s, object completes 1 loop. Work = ?",0 J,36 J,12 J,3 J,A,Direction of force always ⊥ displacement → no work done.
An object moves right 6 m while vertical force of 20 N acts. Work = ?,0,120,60,12,A,"Vertical force, horizontal displacement → θ = 90° → W = 0."
