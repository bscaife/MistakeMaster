Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can work be stored like energy?,"No, work is a process that transfers energy","Yes, work is a form of stored energy",Only for springs,Only for moving masses,A,Work is not a state or stored quantity — it’s the action that changes energy.
What distinguishes energy from work?,Energy can be stored; work is the process of transferring energy,Work is always negative,Energy only exists at rest,Work and energy are identical,A,Work causes a change in energy but cannot be possessed like energy.
Why is it incorrect to say an object 'has work'?,"Because only energy can be stored, not work",Because work is zero,Because energy is massless,Because objects are too small,A,Objects can possess energy but not work — work is done by or on a system.
What happens when work is done on an object?,Its energy changes,It stores work,Its mass increases,It becomes weightless,A,Work transfers energy — it is not stored itself.
Which of the following can be stored?,Energy,Work,Power,Displacement,A,"Potential energy, chemical energy, etc., can be stored — work cannot."
An object is lifted 2 m. What is stored?,Gravitational potential energy,Work,Kinetic energy,Displacement,A,The work done becomes stored as gravitational PE.
"Which of these is a transfer mechanism, not a form of stored energy?",Work,Thermal energy,Chemical energy,Elastic energy,A,Work is the transfer mechanism — it is not stored energy.
A 5 kg box is lifted 2 m. What energy is stored?,98 J of gravitational potential energy,98 J of work,10 J of power,5 J of motion,A,PE = m·g·h = 5·9.8·2 = 98 J — stored as gravitational PE.
A spring is compressed with 20 J of work. What is stored?,20 J of elastic potential energy,20 J of work,Zero,Kinetic energy,A,Work done is transferred into spring energy.
"20 J of work is done pulling a sled. Afterward, what does the sled have?","20 J of energy (KE, PE, etc.)",20 J of stored work,Force,Momentum only,A,Work done on the sled adds energy — 20 J becomes stored KE or PE.
