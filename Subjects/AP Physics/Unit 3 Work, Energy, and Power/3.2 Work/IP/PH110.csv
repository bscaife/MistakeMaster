Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
How are work and energy related?,Work transfers energy to or from a system,They are separate and unrelated,Work stores energy,Only energy affects motion,A,Work is the mechanism that changes an object’s energy — W = ΔKE.
Why is it incorrect to say work and energy are completely separate ideas?,Because work changes energy,Because work is directional,Because energy is a force,Because they cancel each other,A,Work causes a change in energy — they are directly connected through the work-energy theorem.
What is the physical effect of doing work on an object?,It increases or decreases its energy,It changes mass,It adds force,It makes it rotate,A,Work done increases kinetic energy (or transfers potential energy).
Which equation directly links work and energy?,W = ΔKE,F = ma,PE = m·g·h,KE = ½·m·v²,A,Work-energy theorem: net work changes kinetic energy.
When is energy transferred into an object?,When net work is done on it,When it rests,When it is heavy,When it is stationary,A,Work must be done for energy transfer to occur.
What happens when negative work is done on an object?,Its energy decreases,Its mass decreases,It gains force,It becomes frictionless,A,Work can reduce an object’s kinetic energy.
Which of the following best defines work?,Energy transferred via force acting over displacement,Any application of force,Storage of energy,Loss of energy,A,"Work is energy transfer, not just force application."
A 5 kg object speeds up from 2 m/s to 6 m/s. ΔKE = ?,80 J,20 J,60 J,100 J,A,ΔKE = ½·m·(v² - v₀²) = ½·5·(36−4) = ½·5·32 = 80 J.
A person does 120 J of work on a cart. How much energy does the cart gain?,120 J,0,60 J,It depends on time,A,Work transfers energy → energy gained = work done.
A box loses 45 J of KE while friction does work. What is W by friction?,−45 J,45 J,0,90 J,B,Work = ΔKE → friction removes energy = negative work.
