Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH106,Work is always positive,"Assumes any work done adds energy, not realizing work can also remove energy if force opposes motion."
PH107,Work depends only on force,"Ignores displacement in calculating work, thinking applying force alone does work regardless of motion."
PH108,No motion means no work is possible,"Fails to understand that work is zero if there’s no displacement, even if a large force is applied."
PH109,All forces do work,Does not recognize that forces perpendicular to displacement (like centripetal force) do no work.
PH110,Work and energy are separate concepts,"Treats work and energy as unrelated ideas, missing that work transfers energy."
PH111,Path doesn’t matter for nonconservative forces,Misunderstands that forces like friction do more work over longer paths and are not path-independent.
PH112,Work can be stored,"Confuses work (a process of energy transfer) with energy itself, which can be stored."
