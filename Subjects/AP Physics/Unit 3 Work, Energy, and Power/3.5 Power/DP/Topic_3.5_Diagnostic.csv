Which expression defines power in terms of work and time?,A,P = W / t,TRUE,,P = W · t,FALSE,PH129,P = t / W,FALSE,PH129,P = W² / t,FALSE,PH127,Power is rate of energy transfer: P = W / t.
A motor lifts a 50 kg mass to a height of 20 m in 5 s. What is its average power output?,C,500 W,FALSE,PH127,1000 W,FALSE,PH127,P = 1960 W,TRUE,,P = m / t,FALSE,PH127,Work = mgh = 9800 J → P = 9800 / 5 = 1960 W
An object moves at constant speed v under constant force F. What is power delivered?,D,P = F / v,FALSE,PH127,P = v² · F,FALSE,PH129,P = F / v²,FALSE,PH127,P = F · v,TRUE,,When direction aligns— P = F · v.
Which situation involves zero power output?,A,Holding a weight steady at arm’s length.,TRUE,,Lifting a box upward at constant speed.,FALSE,PH127,Pushing against a wall that moves.,FALSE,PH129,Throwing an object upward.,FALSE,PH129,If displacement = 0 → W = 0 → P = 0 even if force is applied.
If two machines do the same work but one is faster— what is true?,D,They use more energy.,FALSE,PH129,The slower one is more powerful.,FALSE,PH127,They exert the same force.,FALSE,PH129,The faster machine has more power.,TRUE,,P = W / t → same W— smaller t → greater P.
Power can also be expressed as which of the following?,C,P = KE / m,FALSE,PH130,P = v / F,FALSE,PH129,P = F · v when F and v are constant and aligned,TRUE,,P = F · a,FALSE,PH130,From W = F · d and v = d / t → P = F · v
A 75 kg person runs up 5 m of stairs in 3 seconds. Estimate power output.,A,P = mgh / t = 1225 W,TRUE,,P = m / t,FALSE,PH127,P = 75·3 / 5 = 45 W,FALSE,PH129,P = 5 / (75·3) = 0.022 W,FALSE,PH127,Use P = mgh / t → 75×9.8×5 / 3 ≈ 1225 W
What does it mean if a machine does more work per second?,D,It is inefficient.,FALSE,PH128,It uses more mass.,FALSE,PH130,It generates less force.,FALSE,PH129,It is more powerful.,TRUE,,Power is work per time — more work in same time = more power.
If mass and height stay constant but time doubles— what happens to power?,B,It doubles.,FALSE,PH129,It halves.,TRUE,,It stays the same.,FALSE,PH129,It increases by factor of 4.,FALSE,PH130,P = W / t = mgh / t → if t doubles— P halves.
Which statement best describes the concept of power?,C,It measures energy lost.,FALSE,PH127,It equals total work done.,FALSE,PH128,It is the rate at which work is done.,TRUE,,It is proportional to mass only.,FALSE,PH130,Power = work per unit time: P = W / t
