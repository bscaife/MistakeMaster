Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which equation correctly defines average power?,P = F·t,P = W/t,P = m·g·h,P = m·a,B,Power is defined as P = W/t — the rate of energy transfer per unit time.
Two people lift the same box to the same height. One takes twice as long. Who produces more power?,The slower one.,They produce equal power.,The faster one.,Neither does any work.,C,"Same work, less time ⇒ P = W/t is greater for the faster person."
A student says power increases the longer a force is applied. What’s the mistake?,Power has nothing to do with force.,Power increases if force is constant.,More time lowers power for the same work.,More time always increases power.,C,P = W/t — spreading same work over more time reduces power.
"If the same amount of work is done over a longer time, what happens to average power?",It increases.,It stays the same.,It decreases.,It doubles.,C,P = W/t — increasing t while keeping W constant causes P to decrease.
Which person generates the most power?,One lifting a weight slowly.,One pushing against a wall.,One carrying a bag at constant speed.,One sprinting upstairs quickly.,D,Sprint = more energy transferred in less time ⇒ higher P = W/t.
A machine does 600 J of work in 3 s. What’s its power output?,200 W,1800 W,3 W,600 W,A,P = W/t = 600 J ÷ 3 s = 200 W.
Which situation shows high energy but low power?,Explosive launch.,Slow elevator rise.,Running up stairs.,Falling quickly.,B,Same energy transferred slowly ⇒ lower P = W/t.
Which unit is equivalent to power?,N·s,J,W,kg·m,C,"Power is measured in watts (W), where 1 W = 1 J/s."
"If a person does more work in less time, what can you say about power?",It’s lower.,It’s higher.,It’s unchanged.,It becomes zero.,B,"P = W/t — less time means greater rate of work, so power increases."
Two runners do equal work. Runner A finishes in half the time. Which is true?,Runner A had less power.,Both had the same power.,Runner A had more power.,Runner B used more energy.,C,P = W/t — less time for same work ⇒ more power.
