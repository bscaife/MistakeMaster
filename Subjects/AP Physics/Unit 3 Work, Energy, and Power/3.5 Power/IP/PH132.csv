Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A car drives at constant speed on level ground. Does it still use power?,"No, because speed is constant.","Yes, to overcome forces like friction and air resistance.","No, because no energy is transferred.",Only during turns.,B,P = F·v — constant speed requires power to maintain force against resistive forces.
Which situation shows continuous power usage?,Holding a book still.,Sliding block with no friction.,Driving at constant speed uphill.,Object at rest.,C,P = F·v — continuous power is needed to work against gravity while maintaining speed uphill.
A student says power is only used during acceleration. What’s the correction?,Power is only used for potential energy.,Power is the force used to move things.,"Power is needed anytime energy is transferred, not just when speeding up.",Power is unrelated to energy.,C,"P = W/t — power depends on energy transfer, which can happen at constant speed."
A fan runs at constant speed. What can you say about its power?,Power is zero because speed is constant.,Power increases with time.,Power is negative.,Power is constant if energy transfer is steady.,D,"If energy transfer is steady (P = W/t), power remains constant."
Which factor affects power output of a moving object?,Only acceleration.,Only mass.,Both force applied and velocity.,Time of day.,C,"P = F·v — even at constant v, if F is applied (e.g., friction), power is required."
What happens to power when a cyclist coasts with no pedaling?,Power output drops to zero.,Energy keeps transferring.,Work increases.,Power increases.,A,No input energy ⇒ no work done ⇒ power = 0.
What’s required to maintain constant speed up a hill?,Zero force and power.,A force but no power.,Constant power to offset gravity.,Acceleration.,C,Constant v up a slope requires continuous energy input ⇒ P = F·v.
Why does a train need power after it has reached cruising speed?,Power is only for starting.,It doesn't need power once moving.,To overcome resistive forces like air drag.,To increase its energy.,C,Sustained motion at constant speed still needs energy to counter friction and drag.
A person carries a box across a room at steady pace. What’s true about power?,Power is zero because speed is constant.,Power depends on direction only.,Power is nonzero if work is done over time.,Power depends only on weight.,C,"P = W/t — if energy is being transferred (e.g., lifting against gravity), power is required."
What does constant power output imply?,The object is speeding up.,Energy is transferred steadily over time.,Force is increasing.,Speed must change.,B,P = W/t — constant power means energy is delivered at a constant rate.
