Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH127,Power and force are the same,"Thinks that applying a large force means high power, not realizing power depends on how quickly energy is transferred."
PH128,Power increases with time,"Confuses energy and power, believing that the longer a force acts, the greater the power, ignoring the rate aspect of power."
PH129,Power is the same as energy,"Misunderstands that power is the rate of energy transfer, not a form of energy itself."
PH130,More power means more force,"Thinks high-power machines must apply more force, even if they do the same work faster."
PH131,Units of power are the same as energy,"Does not recognize that power is measured in watts (J/s), not in joules (energy units)."
PH132,Power is only needed to start motion,"Assumes power is only involved in initiating movement, overlooking sustained energy transfer during motion."
PH133,"If work is done, power is always high","Fails to consider time in power calculations, assuming any work must imply high power regardless of duration."
