Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the key difference between energy and power?,Energy is a rate; power is a quantity.,Power is a rate; energy is a quantity.,They are the same thing.,Energy is measured in watts.,B,Energy (J) is how much; power (W) is how fast — P = E/t.
Which of these is a correct unit of power?,Joule,Newton,Watt,Kilogram,C,"Power is measured in watts (W), which equal J/s."
A student says 'power is stored in a battery.' What’s the correction?,Batteries store watts.,"Batteries store energy, not power.",Batteries store mass.,Batteries store velocity.,B,Batteries store energy (J); power is how fast that energy is used.
"If a machine transfers more energy in less time, what increases?",Energy.,Force.,Power.,Mass.,C,P = ΔE/t — transferring energy faster means higher power.
Which of the following is a form of energy?,Power.,Heat.,Time.,Watts.,B,Heat is a form of energy; power is the rate of transferring it.
What does a power rating of 100 W tell us?,The device uses 100 J of energy every second.,The device stores 100 J.,The device uses 100 N of force.,The device is 100% efficient.,A,P = E/t ⇒ 100 W means 100 J/s are transferred or used.
"If two machines use the same total energy but one runs faster, what differs?",Their energy.,Their mass.,Their power.,Their temperature.,C,Same energy over less time ⇒ higher power (P = E/t).
What is true about energy and power in physics?,They are interchangeable.,Energy measures total work; power measures how quickly it's done.,Power can be converted into energy.,Energy always increases with power.,B,"Energy is a quantity (J), power is a rate (W = J/s)."
Which has more energy use: a 100 W bulb on for 1 hour or 50 W for 2 hours?,Same energy used.,The 100 W bulb.,The 50 W bulb.,Neither uses energy.,A,100 W × 1 hr = 100 Wh; 50 W × 2 hr = 100 Wh — energy used is equal.
A runner uses 600 J of energy in 30 s. What is their average power?,20 W,60 W,18 W,30 W,A,P = E/t = 600 J ÷ 30 s = 20 W.
