Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which correctly explains what determines power output?,Only force applied.,Work done and time taken.,Mass and energy stored.,Friction and distance only.,B,Power is P = W/t — it depends on how much work is done and how quickly it’s done.
Two machines lift the same weight the same height. Machine A does it twice as fast. What’s true?,Machine A uses more force.,Machine A does more work.,Machine A has more power.,Machine B is stronger.,C,Same work in less time ⇒ higher P = W/t for Machine A.
A student says a more powerful car must apply more force. What’s wrong?,Force is always the same.,More power can come from moving faster with the same force.,Power and force are equal.,Only velocity matters.,B,P = F·v — higher power can come from greater v even with constant F.
Which pair can result in the same power output?,"Large force, slow speed and small force, high speed.",Two equal forces with no motion.,Two different masses at rest.,Different distances only.,A,P = F·v — increasing one while decreasing the other can keep power constant.
A person climbs stairs faster than another. What’s different?,They do more work.,They exert more force.,They have greater power.,They weigh more.,C,Same height (work) in less time ⇒ higher power.
What’s a key factor for increasing power without increasing force?,More time.,Less distance.,Higher speed.,Higher mass.,C,"P = F·v — with constant F, increasing v increases power."
Which situation shows high power but not high force?,Heavy weight lifted slowly.,Light object moved quickly.,Object held still.,Block sliding at constant speed.,B,High speed with small force ⇒ P = F·v can still be large.
"If two students push with equal force but one runs, who delivers more power?",The runner.,The slower student.,They’re equal.,Neither — same force.,A,"P = F·v — same force, higher speed = higher power."
Which would double power output without increasing force?,Double mass.,Double distance.,Double speed.,Double time.,C,P = F·v — doubling v while keeping F constant doubles P.
What does high power output mean?,More energy used slowly.,More force with no motion.,Energy is transferred quickly.,Object is heavier.,C,Power is the rate of energy transfer — more energy per second = more power.
