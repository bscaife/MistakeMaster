Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which formula best defines power in mechanics?,P = m·a,P = F·v,P = m·g,P = F·t,B,Mechanical power is P = F·v — it depends on both applied force and velocity.
Two people push boxes with equal force. One finishes in half the time. Who delivers more power?,Both deliver same power.,The slower one.,The faster one.,Neither — power isn't related to time.,C,P = W/t — same work done faster means greater power.
A student says larger force always means more power. What’s the error?,Power is unrelated to force.,Power depends only on mass.,Power depends on both force and speed.,Force must always be vertical.,C,P = F·v — larger force doesn’t mean more power unless speed is also considered.
Which would result in higher power output?,Lifting a box slowly with large force.,Holding a box still.,Lifting same box quickly.,Using more friction.,C,P = W/t — shorter time (faster lift) means greater power for same work.
A person applies a constant force but object doesn’t move. What is the power?,Equal to applied force.,Infinite.,"Zero, since no work is done.",Equal to object's weight.,C,"P = W/t — if object doesn’t move, W = 0, so P = 0."
Which situation shows high force but low power?,Pulling a sled quickly.,Holding a heavy box still.,Running upstairs.,Pushing a cart fast.,B,"No displacement = no work = no power, even if large force is applied."
Which of the following is a correct unit for power?,N·m,Joule,Watt,m/s²,C,"Power is measured in watts (W), where 1 W = 1 J/s."
What would double the power output?,Doubling time.,Doing same work in half the time.,Increasing force but decreasing velocity.,Halving both force and speed.,B,P = W/t — less time for same work increases power.
"If a machine exerts constant force while doubling speed, what happens to power?",It remains constant.,It decreases.,It doubles.,It becomes zero.,C,P = F·v — doubling v doubles power if F is constant.
Why is a fast-moving cyclist more powerful than a slow walker even if they push with same force?,Force determines everything.,Mass is greater.,Power depends on both force and velocity.,Power is constant regardless of speed.,C,P = F·v — higher velocity leads to greater power output with same force.
