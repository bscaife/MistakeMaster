An object of mass m moves at speed v. What is its kinetic energy?,C,K = m · v,FALSE,PH99,K = ½ · m · v,FALSE,PH100,K = ½ · m · v²,TRUE,,K = m · v²,FALSE,PH99,Kinetic energy depends on square of speed: K = ½·m·v²
If an object’s speed doubles— how does its kinetic energy change?,A,It quadruples.,TRUE,,It doubles.,FALSE,PH100,It remains the same.,FALSE,PH103,It halves.,FALSE,PH103,K = ½·m·v² → if v doubles— KE increases by factor of 4.
Two objects have equal kinetic energy. One has twice the mass of the other. What is the speed ratio?,D,v₁ = v₂,FALSE,PH100,v₁ = 2 · v₂,FALSE,PH100,v₁ = √2 · v₂,FALSE,PH100,v₁ = v₂ / √2,TRUE,,K = ½·m·v² → solve for v = √(2K / m). If m doubles— v must drop by √2.
What is the total kinetic energy of a system of two blocks: m₁ = 2 kg at 3 m/s— m₂ = 4 kg at 2 m/s?,B,KE = ½(2+4)(3+2)²,FALSE,PH100,KE = 17 J,TRUE,,KE = ½(6)(5²),FALSE,PH105,KE = m · v,FALSE,PH99,KE is scalar → add individual KE: ½·m₁·v₁² + ½·m₂·v₂²
An object of unknown mass has kinetic energy K and speed v. What is its mass?,A,m = 2K / v²,TRUE,,m = K / v,FALSE,PH104,m = K / v²,FALSE,PH104,m = v² / K,FALSE,PH104,Solve K = ½·m·v² for m: multiply both sides by 2 and divide by v²
A block's speed increases from v to 2v. What is the change in kinetic energy?,D,ΔK = 2K,FALSE,PH100,ΔK = ½·m·v,FALSE,PH104,ΔK = m·v²,FALSE,PH100,ΔK = ½·m·3v²,TRUE,,Initial KE = ½·m·v²; final KE = ½·m·(2v)² = 2m·v² → ∆K = 1.5m·v²
If two cars with equal mass collide and stop— what happens to their combined kinetic energy?,B,It increases.,FALSE,PH103,It is transferred or transformed (e.g.— heat— sound).,TRUE,,It becomes potential energy.,FALSE,PH102,It is destroyed.,FALSE,PH101,Energy is conserved but changes form — KE can become thermal— etc.
Which variable has the greatest effect on kinetic energy?,C,Mass.,FALSE,PH104,Direction of motion.,FALSE,PH101,Speed.,TRUE,,Position.,FALSE,PH101,K = ½·m·v² → v² means KE is more sensitive to speed.
If K = 125 J and m = 5 kg— what is the speed of the object?,D,v = 50,FALSE,PH104,v = 5,FALSE,PH104,v = 10,FALSE,PH104,v = 7.1 m/s,TRUE,,Solve K = ½·m·v² → v = √(2K / m)
Which of these best defines kinetic energy?,A,Energy due to motion— proportional to m and v²,TRUE,,Energy stored in a spring.,FALSE,PH99,Energy related to height.,FALSE,PH102,Force over distance.,FALSE,PH101,KE is energy of motion — K = ½·m·v².
