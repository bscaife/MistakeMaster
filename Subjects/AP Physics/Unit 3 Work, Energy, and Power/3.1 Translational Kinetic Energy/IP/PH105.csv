Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does an object gain kinetic energy just because a force is present?,"No, the force must do work through displacement","Yes, force alone increases energy",Only if friction is small,Only for vertical forces,A,Kinetic energy changes only when net work is done — force × displacement.
What is required to increase an object’s kinetic energy?,A net force acting over a displacement,Any applied force,A negative acceleration,Only tension,A,Work = F·d — energy changes only with motion and force aligned.
When does force increase energy?,When it causes motion in the direction of the force,Whenever it exists,Only on ramps,During equilibrium,A,"If the object doesn’t move, or moves perpendicularly, KE doesn’t change."
Why does a book sitting on a table not gain KE despite gravity acting?,Because there’s no displacement — no work is done,Because mass is constant,Because friction cancels,Because gravity is weak,A,Force alone doesn’t cause energy transfer — motion is required.
How is kinetic energy related to work?,The net work done equals the change in kinetic energy,They are unrelated,Kinetic energy causes force,Work is always negative,A,Work–energy theorem: Wₙₑₜ = ΔKE.
Which of the following is true about work and force?,Work requires both force and displacement,Force alone produces energy,Force acts only with motion,Displacement is unnecessary,A,Force × distance = work → required to change KE.
Which of the following objects gains KE?,One being accelerated forward,One held still,One in equilibrium,One compressed,A,KE increases only when speed increases — requires motion.
"F = 10 N, d = 5 m in direction of motion. Work = ?",50 J,10 J,5 J,0 J,A,W = F·d = 10·5 = 50 J → KE increases by 50 J.
"F = 10 N upward, object moves horizontally 5 m. Work = ?",0 J,50 J,10 J,5 J,A,No work — motion is perpendicular to force → KE unchanged.
Box pulled 4 m with force of 15 N. Net work = ?,60 J,30 J,45 J,0 J,A,W = F·d = 15 × 4 = 60 J → KE increases.
