Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH99,Kinetic energy is a vector,"Mistakenly thinks kinetic energy has direction, not realizing it is a scalar quantity."
PH100,Faster objects always have more kinetic energy,"Ignores mass in calculating kinetic energy, believing speed alone determines energy."
PH101,All observers measure the same kinetic energy,"Does not understand that kinetic energy depends on the frame of reference, which affects the measured velocity."
PH102,Kinetic energy depends on total distance traveled,Confuses displacement or distance with velocity in calculating kinetic energy.
PH103,Kinetic energy can be negative,"Misapplies signed velocity into the formula KE = ½mv², which always yields a positive value."
PH104,Only moving objects have energy,Overlooks potential energy and assumes stationary objects have no energy at all.
PH105,An object gains kinetic energy just from force,"Thinks kinetic energy increases just because a force is present, ignoring the need for displacement and net work."
