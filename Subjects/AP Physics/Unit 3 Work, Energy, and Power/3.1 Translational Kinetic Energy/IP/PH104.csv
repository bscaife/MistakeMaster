Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Do only moving objects have energy?,"No, stationary objects can have potential energy due to position","Yes, energy only exists with motion",Only rotating objects store energy,Only heat counts,A,Potential energy exists even if the object is at rest — energy is not just kinetic.
Which of the following has energy while not moving?,An object held at a height,A ball at rest on a table,A falling object,A rolling wheel,A,"Gravitational potential energy depends on height, not motion."
Why is it incorrect to say a motionless object has no energy?,Because potential energy can exist without movement,Because energy has direction,Because weight is zero,Because mass cancels energy,A,PE = m·g·h is nonzero for elevated or stretched systems.
What type of energy does a stretched spring have at rest?,Elastic potential energy,None,Kinetic,Heat,A,"It’s not moving, but stores energy due to its deformation."
Which system has energy even when not in motion?,Mass held above ground,Ball rolling,Rocket in air,Object in vacuum,A,Gravitational potential energy doesn’t require motion.
An object is resting on a hilltop. What energy does it have?,Potential energy due to elevation,None,Kinetic energy,Momentum,A,Its position in the gravitational field stores energy.
Which of the following best describes potential energy?,Stored energy due to position or configuration,Energy from motion,A force field,A negative kinetic energy,A,"PE includes gravitational, elastic, electrical, etc."
"m = 2 kg, h = 5 m. PE = ? (g = 9.8)",98 J,10 J,50 J,0 J,A,PE = m·g·h = 2·9.8·5 = 98 J.
"Spring: k = 300 N/m, x = 0.2 m. Stored energy = ?",6 J,12 J,60 J,0.6 J,A,U = ½·k·x² = 0.5·300·0.04 = 6 J.
"An object is at rest, h = 10 m. m = 3 kg. What energy?",294 J potential,0 J,30 J kinetic,3 J work,A,PE = m·g·h = 3·9.8·10 = 294 J.
