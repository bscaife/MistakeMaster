Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does a faster object always have more kinetic energy than a slower object?,"No, because mass also affects kinetic energy","Yes, speed alone determines energy",Only in freefall,Only with gravity present,A,KE = ½·m·v² — both mass and speed matter. A heavier slow object can have more KE than a light fast one.
Which factor besides speed affects kinetic energy?,Mass,Height,Temperature,Direction,A,Mass contributes directly to kinetic energy: KE = ½·m·v².
Which of the following has the most kinetic energy?,A 10 kg object moving at 2 m/s,A 5 kg object at 3 m/s,A 1 kg object at 8 m/s,A 0.5 kg object at 10 m/s,A,KE = ½·10·4 = 20 J; the others are lower when computed.
Why can a slower object sometimes have more kinetic energy than a faster one?,Because it has a larger mass,Because it is moving upward,Because of friction,Because of velocity direction,A,Mass is just as important in calculating kinetic energy as speed.
What happens to kinetic energy if mass doubles and speed stays the same?,It doubles,It stays the same,It halves,It quadruples,A,KE ∝ m — doubling mass → doubles KE.
Two identical objects move at different speeds. Which has more KE?,The faster one,The heavier one,The slower one,The one with higher momentum,A,"If mass is the same, KE depends only on v² — faster → more KE."
What would be the mistake in comparing kinetic energies using only speed?,"Ignoring mass, which also affects KE",Forgetting about friction,Overestimating potential energy,Misusing gravity,A,Speed alone isn’t enough — mass contributes equally in the equation.
"m = 4 kg, v = 3 m/s. KE = ?",18 J,12 J,24 J,9 J,A,KE = ½·4·9 = 18 J.
Which object has more KE: 6 kg at 2 m/s or 2 kg at 4 m/s?,6 kg object,2 kg object,Both the same,Neither has KE,B,"KE₁ = ½·6·4 = 12 J, KE₂ = ½·2·16 = 16 J → 2 kg object wins."
An object doubles its speed. KE becomes?,Four times larger,Twice as large,The same,Half as large,A,KE ∝ v² → doubling v means 4× KE.
