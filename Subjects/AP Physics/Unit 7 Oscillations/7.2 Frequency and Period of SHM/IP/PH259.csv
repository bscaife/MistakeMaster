Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student claims that frequency is a property of the object itself. What is wrong with this idea?,Only amplitude depends on the object,Frequency is set by external forces only,"Frequency depends on the system setup, not just the object",Frequency doesn’t exist in SHM,C,Frequency is determined by the system’s conditions — such as spring constant or pendulum length — not by the object’s mass or shape alone.
Which factor does NOT determine the frequency of a mass-spring system?,Spring constant,Mass of the object,Color of the object,System configuration,C,Only system-dependent physical quantities like m and k determine frequency: f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)). Color is irrelevant.
Why do two identical objects swing at different rates on different pendulums?,Because their masses differ,Because length of the pendulum determines timing,Because SHM depends on air resistance,Because the heavier one moves slower,B,"T = 2·π·√(L/g) — period depends on pendulum length, not the object itself."
Which of these most influences period in SHM?,Shape of the mass,Material of the object,"System setup (e.g., L or k)",Amplitude of motion,C,"Only system parameters (spring constant, pendulum length) determine period. Object properties like shape are irrelevant in ideal SHM."
Why can the same object have different SHM periods in different setups?,Because energy is not conserved,Because mass fluctuates,Because the system’s configuration determines period,Because SHM changes randomly,C,"Period is a function of system parameters: T = 2·π·√(m/k) or T = 2·π·√(L/g), depending on the configuration."
Two identical spheres hang from strings of different lengths. Why do they swing at different rates?,Their shapes are slightly different,Their masses are slightly off,Pendulum length determines period,Their densities are not equal,C,"Period is determined by T = 2·π·√(L/g), so pendulum length — not object mass or shape — causes the difference."
A teacher claims 'the object doesn’t matter' when determining SHM frequency. What does this mean?,Frequency is always constant,"Only system characteristics matter, not mass or design of the object",Motion depends only on energy,Objects do not undergo SHM,B,"In ideal systems, period and frequency are governed by parameters like spring constant or length — not the object’s shape or composition."
Which of the following does frequency depend on for a pendulum?,Mass of the bob,Material of the string,Length of the pendulum,Shape of the bob,C,"f = 1/(2·π·√(L/g)) — frequency is based on system setup, not properties of the bob."
Why might a metal and wooden ball swing at the same rate on identical strings?,They are the same color,Their densities cancel out,"Length controls period, not material",Air resistance equalizes them,C,Mass and material don’t affect period in SHM. Identical lengths → identical periods: T = 2·π·√(L/g).
Which best corrects the idea that period is an object’s property?,"Period is determined by system variables, not just the object itself",Period varies due to object color,Only non-objects have period,Every object has its own built-in frequency,A,Period is not intrinsic to the object — it depends on setup: T = 2·π·√(m/k) or T = 2·π·√(L/g).
