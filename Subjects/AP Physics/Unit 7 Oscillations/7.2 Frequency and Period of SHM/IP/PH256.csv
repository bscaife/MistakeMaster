Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student believes heavier pendulums swing faster. What is the correct principle?,Heavier pendulums swing slower,Mass does not affect pendulum frequency,Only heavier pendulums work in SHM,"Mass affects amplitude, not frequency",B,"For small-angle oscillations, pendulum frequency is f = 1/(2·π·√(L/g)), which does not include mass."
Which variable affects the frequency of a simple pendulum?,Mass of the bob,Amplitude of the swing,Length of the pendulum,Shape of the bob,C,"Pendulum frequency is determined by f = 1/(2·π·√(L/g)). Only the length (L) and gravity (g) affect the timing, not mass."
What happens to the period of a pendulum if the bob's mass is doubled?,It doubles,It halves,It remains the same,It increases by √2,C,"Period is T = 2·π·√(L/g), so changing mass has no effect on timing."
"If two pendulums have the same length but different masses, how do their frequencies compare?",The heavier one swings faster,The lighter one swings faster,They swing at the same frequency,Neither will swing,C,"Pendulum frequency depends only on length and gravity, not mass, so both will swing identically."
Why doesn't mass affect the period of a pendulum?,Because it cancels out in the force and acceleration equations,Because gravity doesn't affect pendulums,Because force is constant,Because air resistance balances the effect,A,"Using Newton’s second law and gravitational force, mass cancels: T = 2·π·√(L/g). The motion is independent of mass."
Which formula supports the idea that pendulum frequency doesn’t depend on mass?,f = 1/(2·π·√(L/g)),f = √(m/L),f = m·g/L,f = A·m,A,"The correct formula is f = 1/(2·π·√(L/g)), which includes length and gravity, but no mass term."
Two students build pendulums of the same length but with different bob materials. What do they observe?,The heavier bob swings slower,The lighter bob swings faster,Both bobs swing with the same timing,The lighter bob swings erratically,C,"Mass doesn’t affect SHM for pendulums. As long as lengths are equal, the frequencies are equal too."
"A pendulum has a period of 2 s. If the mass is doubled, what will the new period be?",1 s,2 s,4 s,Cannot be determined,B,"T = 2·π·√(L/g) doesn’t include mass, so the period remains 2 s even with a heavier bob."
Why do textbooks often ignore mass when deriving the period of a pendulum?,Because mass is negligible,Because SHM doesn’t use Newton’s laws,Because mass cancels in the derivation,Because gravity also depends on mass,C,"In F = m·a and F = m·g·sinθ, mass appears on both sides and cancels, so it doesn’t affect the final period formula."
What determines how fast a pendulum swings in ideal conditions?,The weight of the bob,The length of the string,The width of the arc,The shape of the pendulum,B,"Only length and gravity matter in T = 2·π·√(L/g), so length determines the pendulum’s swing frequency."
