Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says shorter pendulums take longer to swing. What’s the correct relationship?,Shorter pendulums have longer periods,Shorter pendulums swing more slowly,Shorter pendulums swing more quickly,Length has no effect on period,C,"T = 2·π·√(L/g) shows that period decreases as length decreases. So shorter pendulums swing faster, not slower."
"According to the pendulum period formula, what happens if the length is cut in half?",Period doubles,Period is cut in half,Period decreases by factor of √2,Period increases by factor of √2,C,"T = 2·π·√(L/g). If L is halved, T becomes 2·π·√(L/2g) = T₀/√2, so the period is shorter by √2."
Which of these pendulums has the shortest period?,1 meter long,0.5 meters long,2 meters long,All are the same,B,T = 2·π·√(L/g) — the shortest length gives the smallest square root and therefore the shortest period.
What variable affects how long it takes a pendulum to complete one swing?,Mass,Length,Amplitude,Material of string,B,Period of a pendulum depends on length: T = 2·π·√(L/g). None of the other factors affect period in ideal SHM.
Two pendulums of lengths 1 m and 4 m are released. Which swings slower?,The 1 m pendulum,The 4 m pendulum,They swing at the same rate,Not enough info,B,"Longer pendulums have longer periods (T = 2·π·√(L/g)), so the 4 m pendulum swings more slowly."
Why do shorter pendulums complete more cycles per second?,They experience more gravity,They have lower mass,They have shorter periods,They move more efficiently,C,"Shorter L → smaller T = 2·π·√(L/g), meaning more swings per unit time (higher frequency)."
A student says a small pendulum moves slowly because it's short. What’s wrong with this reasoning?,Shorter pendulums always stop,Speed doesn’t depend on length,Shorter pendulums actually swing faster,Period doesn’t change with length,C,"T = 2·π·√(L/g). Shorter pendulums have shorter periods and higher frequencies — they move faster, not slower."
How does doubling the length of a pendulum affect its period?,Doubles the period,Halves the period,Multiplies the period by √2,Multiplies the period by √2,D,"T = 2·π·√(L/g). Doubling L gives T = 2·π·√(2L/g) = T₀·√2, so period increases by √2."
Which of the following correctly describes the length-period relationship for pendulums?,Linear,Inverse,Square root,Constant,C,The pendulum period formula T = 2·π·√(L/g) shows a square root relationship between length and period.
What is the most efficient way to make a pendulum swing faster?,Add mass,Decrease amplitude,Shorten the string,Change the bob’s shape,C,"To reduce period and increase swing rate, shorten the length — T = 2·π·√(L/g) depends only on L and g."
