Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student claims all SHM systems have the same period. What is wrong with this idea?,Amplitude is the only factor that changes period,SHM systems always have equal energy,Different systems have different parameters like mass or spring constant,All SHM systems have zero net force,C,Period depends on system-specific variables: T = 2·π·√(m/k) for spring systems or T = 2·π·√(L/g) for pendulums.
Which of these affects the period of a spring-mass oscillator?,Spring constant and mass,Amplitude and direction,Mass and color of spring,Spring constant and amplitude,A,"T = 2·π·√(m/k). The period depends only on mass and spring constant, not on amplitude or direction."
Two pendulums are the same mass but different lengths. What is true about their periods?,They are equal,The shorter pendulum swings slower,The longer pendulum has a longer period,Mass determines their timing,C,"T = 2·π·√(L/g), so greater length leads to greater period. Mass does not affect pendulum timing."
Which of the following will make two SHM systems have the same period?,Equal masses only,Equal amplitudes only,"Same system parameters like m and k, or L and g",Same shapes of the object,C,"Only if both systems share the same period-determining values (e.g., m and k for springs or L for pendulums) will their periods match."
"If two SHM systems have different masses and spring constants, what can be said about their periods?",They are always equal,They are impossible to compare,They are equal if m/k is the same,They always differ,C,"T = 2·π·√(m/k). If the ratio m/k is the same in both, then their periods are equal even if m and k are different."
Which pair of systems will definitely have different SHM periods?,"Same mass, different spring constants","Same spring constant, same mass",Same length pendulums,Same values of m/k,A,"T = 2·π·√(m/k). If k changes while m stays the same, the period must change too."
Which SHM system has the longest period?,"Small mass, strong spring","Large mass, weak spring",Short pendulum,Any system with high frequency,B,"A large mass and a weak spring increase m and decrease k, which increases T = 2·π·√(m/k)."
Two mass-spring systems have different spring constants. What must be true for them to oscillate with the same period?,They must have equal mass,Their amplitudes must match,The ratio m/k must be the same,The same energy must be stored,C,"For T = 2·π·√(m/k), the ratio m/k must match for periods to be equal, regardless of the values individually."
What determines the period of SHM for a spring-mass oscillator?,Spring constant and mass,Amplitude and force,Position and time,Mass and velocity,A,"T = 2·π·√(m/k), so mass and spring constant determine the period."
What is the key reason not all SHM systems have the same period?,Amplitude varies,Systems store different energy,Period depends on system-specific variables,Motion is not oscillatory,C,"The period depends on unique system properties like spring constant, mass, or pendulum length. That’s why periods differ."
