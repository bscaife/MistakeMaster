Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says increasing the amplitude of oscillation makes the system oscillate faster. What is the actual effect on frequency in ideal SHM?,Frequency increases,Frequency decreases,Frequency remains the same,Frequency becomes zero,C,"In ideal SHM, frequency is independent of amplitude. For a mass-spring system, f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)) — amplitude does not appear in the formula."
Which change will affect the frequency of an ideal spring-mass oscillator?,Increasing amplitude,Decreasing amplitude,Increasing spring constant,Increasing energy,C,Frequency depends on spring constant and mass: f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)). Changing amplitude or energy does not affect it.
"If amplitude doubles in a pendulum with small angular displacement, what happens to the frequency?",It doubles,It is halved,It remains constant,It increases by √2,C,"In ideal conditions (small angles), pendulum frequency f = 1/(2·π·√(L/g)) is not affected by amplitude."
A spring-mass system is stretched further than before. What is the effect on frequency in SHM?,Frequency increases,Frequency decreases,Frequency stays the same,Frequency becomes infinite,C,Amplitude changes the energy but not the frequency. Frequency remains constant in ideal SHM.
What happens to the frequency of a mass-spring system if the mass is stretched to twice the amplitude?,It doubles,It is halved,It stays the same,It becomes zero,C,f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)) is independent of amplitude. Larger amplitude increases total energy but not frequency.
Which SHM quantity is NOT affected by changing amplitude in an ideal system?,Frequency,Maximum speed,Total energy,Maximum acceleration,A,"Only frequency stays constant in ideal SHM regardless of amplitude. Other values like speed, energy, and acceleration do depend on amplitude."
Why doesn’t amplitude affect frequency in ideal SHM?,Because restoring force becomes nonlinear,Because energy is conserved,Because force remains constant,Because frequency is determined by system properties only,D,"In ideal SHM, frequency depends only on mass and spring constant or length and gravity — not on amplitude."
What increases when amplitude is increased in SHM?,Period,Frequency,Maximum velocity,Spring constant,C,"Amplitude increases max speed since v₍max₎ = ω·A. However, frequency remains unchanged in ideal SHM."
Which formula supports the idea that amplitude doesn’t affect frequency?,f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)),f = A²/2m,f = m·A/k,f = A·k,A,"Amplitude does not appear in f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)), which proves that frequency is independent of how far the mass is stretched."
A student claims that a taller swing will swing faster. What is the correct response for small-angle SHM?,That’s correct,The swing speed depends on height only,"Swing length, not amplitude, determines period",The mass must be heavier to affect frequency,C,"For small-angle pendulums, period depends on length (T = 2·π·√(L/g)). Height of the swing (amplitude) doesn’t affect timing."
