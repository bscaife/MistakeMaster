Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH253,Frequency and period are unrelated,"Fails to understand that frequency and period are reciprocals, and changes in one directly affect the other."
PH254,More mass always means higher frequency,"Assumes mass increases frequency, when in fact it increases period and lowers frequency in systems like mass-spring oscillators."
PH255,Amplitude affects frequency in SHM,Incorrectly believes that increasing the swing height (amplitude) affects the timing of oscillation for ideal systems.
PH256,Pendulum frequency depends on mass,"Mistakenly believes that heavier pendulums swing faster or slower, ignoring that period depends on length, not mass."
PH257,Shorter pendulums take longer to swing,"Reverses the relationship between length and period, believing shorter lengths result in longer oscillation times."
PH258,All SHM systems have the same period,Ignores differences in system parameters such as spring constant or length that determine the oscillation period.
PH259,Period and frequency are properties of the object,Treats these as inherent traits of the mass or shape rather than dependent on the system setup and conditions.
