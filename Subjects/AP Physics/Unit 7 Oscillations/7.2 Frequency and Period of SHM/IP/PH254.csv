Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says adding mass to a spring will make it oscillate faster. What actually happens?,The frequency increases,The period decreases,The frequency decreases,There is no change,C,"The frequency of a mass-spring system is f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)). Increasing mass increases the denominator, which decreases frequency."
"In the formula for a spring-mass system’s frequency, what effect does mass have?",It increases frequency,It has no effect,It decreases frequency,It only affects amplitude,C,The frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of mass: f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)). More mass lowers frequency.
What happens to the oscillation period of a spring-mass system if the mass increases?,It decreases,It increases,It stays the same,It becomes negative,B,"Period is T = 2·π·√(m/k). Increasing m increases the square root term, so the period increases."
Which formula explains why a larger mass results in lower frequency for a spring-mass system?,f = m·k,f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)),f = k/m,f = m/k²,B,"The correct relationship is f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)), showing that more mass increases the denominator and decreases frequency."
What physical reasoning explains why more mass decreases oscillation frequency?,It increases restoring force,It increases resistance to acceleration,It shortens the oscillation path,It increases energy,B,"More mass means greater inertia, slowing response to the restoring force, resulting in a lower frequency of oscillation."
A mass-spring system’s frequency is reduced. What likely changed?,The spring constant increased,The amplitude was doubled,The mass was increased,The direction was reversed,C,"Increasing mass in f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)) lowers the frequency, since it slows down the oscillation rate."
Which of these systems will have the highest oscillation frequency?,"Heavy mass, weak spring","Heavy mass, stiff spring","Light mass, stiff spring","Light mass, weak spring",C,f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)) shows frequency is highest when mass is small and spring constant is large.
A student adds more mass to a vibrating spring and notices the motion slows. Why?,The spring becomes weaker,The increased mass lowers the system’s frequency,The energy dissipates faster,"The spring stretches more, so it finishes faster",B,More mass reduces frequency in f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k)). The system oscillates more slowly due to increased inertia.
What is the effect of increasing mass on the kinetic energy of the oscillator at a given frequency?,It increases KE without affecting motion,It causes KE and frequency to increase,It lowers KE because motion stops,It increases KE but decreases frequency,D,"Greater mass increases maximum kinetic energy (K = ½·m·v²) if v is unchanged, but frequency decreases due to slower motion."
"If a system oscillates slower after a change, which variable most likely increased?",Mass,Spring constant,Amplitude,Gravity,A,"A slower oscillation implies a longer period and lower frequency, which results from increased mass: f = 1/(2·π·√(m/k))."
