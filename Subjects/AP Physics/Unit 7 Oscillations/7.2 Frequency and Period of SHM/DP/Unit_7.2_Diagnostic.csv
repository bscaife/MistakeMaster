Question,Correct Answer,Choice A,Correct? A,Code A,Choice B,Correct? B,Code B,Choice C,Correct? C,Code C,Choice D,Correct? D,Code D,Explanation
Which statement correctly describes the relationship between frequency and period in SHM?,A,They are reciprocals of each other,TRUE,,They are unrelated,FALSE,PH253,They are equal,FALSE,PH253,They change independently,FALSE,PH253,Frequency f and period T are related by f = 1/T; they are inversely proportional.
"For a mass-spring system, what happens to the frequency if the mass is increased?",B,It increases,FALSE,PH254,It decreases,TRUE,,It stays the same regardless of mass,FALSE,PH254,It oscillates randomly,FALSE,PH254,"f = (1/2π)√(k/m), so increasing m decreases frequency."
How does amplitude affect the frequency of ideal SHM?,C,Larger amplitude increases frequency,FALSE,PH255,Larger amplitude decreases frequency,FALSE,PH255,It does not affect frequency,TRUE,,Amplitude changes frequency only in pendulums,FALSE,PH255,"In ideal SHM, frequency depends on system parameters like k and m, not amplitude."
"For a simple pendulum, what affects its frequency?",D,Mass of the pendulum bob,FALSE,PH256,Amplitude of swing,FALSE,PH255,Type of string,FALSE,PH256,Length of the pendulum,TRUE,,"For small oscillations, frequency depends on length and gravity only, not mass or string type."
"If a pendulum length is doubled, what happens to its frequency?",A,It decreases,TRUE,,It increases,FALSE,PH257,It stays the same,FALSE,PH253,It doubles,FALSE,PH257,"f = (1/2π)√(g/L), so increasing L decreases frequency."
"If the mass on a spring is halved, what happens to its frequency?",B,It decreases,FALSE,PH254,It increases,TRUE,,It stays constant,FALSE,PH254,It depends only on amplitude,FALSE,PH255,"f = (1/2π)√(k/m), so reducing m increases frequency."
"If the period of a pendulum is 2 s, what is its frequency?",C,2 Hz,FALSE,PH253,0.25 Hz,FALSE,PH253,0.5 Hz,TRUE,,4 Hz,FALSE,PH253,f = 1/T = 1/2 s = 0.5 Hz.
"For two pendulums of equal length but different masses, how will their frequencies compare?",D,The heavier one swings slower,FALSE,PH256,The heavier one swings faster,FALSE,PH256,It depends on amplitude,FALSE,PH255,They will be the same,TRUE,,"For small oscillations, frequency is independent of mass."
"If a pendulum's length is shortened, what happens to its frequency?",A,It increases,TRUE,,It decreases,FALSE,PH257,It remains constant,FALSE,PH253,It depends on bob mass,FALSE,PH256,Shorter length means higher frequency: f = (1/2π)√(g/L).
"If the amplitude of a mass-spring system is doubled, what happens to its period?",B,It doubles,FALSE,PH255,It remains the same,TRUE,,It halves,FALSE,PH255,It increases slightly,FALSE,PH255,"For ideal SHM, period T is independent of amplitude."
