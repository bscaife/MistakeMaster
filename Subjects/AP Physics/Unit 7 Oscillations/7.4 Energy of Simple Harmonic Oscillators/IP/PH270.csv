Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says potential energy is zero during motion in SHM. What is the correct understanding?,Potential energy appears only at the turning points,Potential energy is always constant,Potential energy continuously varies with displacement,Potential energy is zero unless at rest,C,"In SHM, potential energy U = ½·k·x² varies with displacement. It’s not zero except at the equilibrium position (x = 0)."
What is the value of potential energy at equilibrium in SHM?,Maximum,Zero,Negative,Constant,B,"At equilibrium (x = 0), U = ½·k·x² = 0. This is the only point where potential energy is zero."
When is potential energy at its maximum in SHM?,At equilibrium,When velocity is maximum,At maximum displacement,At the midpoint of motion,C,"Potential energy is proportional to x², so it reaches its maximum at the furthest displacement from equilibrium."
What determines the potential energy in a spring-mass SHM system?,Mass only,Velocity only,Displacement from equilibrium,Time elapsed,C,"U = ½·k·x² shows that potential energy depends on displacement from equilibrium, not time or velocity."
How does potential energy behave as the mass approaches equilibrium in SHM?,It increases,It stays constant,It decreases to zero,It becomes kinetic energy,C,"As the mass approaches x = 0, U = ½·k·x² decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium."
Which graph best describes potential energy over time in SHM?,Linear increase,Sinusoidal with two peaks per cycle,Flat constant value,One peak per cycle,B,"Since U depends on x², and x varies sinusoidally, potential energy peaks twice per oscillation (at ±A)."
"When potential energy is decreasing in SHM, what happens to kinetic energy?",It decreases too,It stays the same,It increases,It becomes undefined,C,"As PE decreases, KE increases so total energy stays constant. Energy transfers back and forth between forms."
"In SHM, why is potential energy never zero except at equilibrium?",Because velocity is zero there,Because acceleration is zero there,Because potential energy depends on displacement squared,Because time is zero there,C,"Potential energy is U = ½·k·x², which is zero only when x = 0, i.e., at equilibrium."
"If the displacement is nonzero in SHM, what can we say about the potential energy?",It must be zero,It must be increasing,It is greater than zero,It becomes kinetic energy,C,"Since U = ½·k·x², if x ≠ 0, then U > 0. The object has stored potential energy."
Why does a student mistakenly believe PE is zero during motion?,They confuse PE with total energy,They ignore displacement in between extremes,They assume energy doesn’t change,They mix PE and KE graphs,B,Students may not realize that any nonzero displacement implies some PE. PE continuously varies with x during motion.
