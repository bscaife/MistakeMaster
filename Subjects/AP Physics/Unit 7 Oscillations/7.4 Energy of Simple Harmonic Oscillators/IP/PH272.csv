Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says total energy in SHM depends only on mass. What’s the correct understanding?,Total energy is mass-dependent only,Total energy is constant regardless of parameters,Total energy depends on amplitude and spring constant too,Mass and gravity determine energy,C,Total mechanical energy in SHM is E = ½·k·A². It depends on both amplitude and spring constant — not just mass.
What is the correct formula for total mechanical energy in a mass-spring SHM system?,E = ½·m·v²,E = ½·k·A²,E = m·g·A,E = k·A,B,"E = ½·k·A² describes total energy in SHM. Mass is not directly in the expression — it affects period, not energy."
"If amplitude is doubled in SHM, how does total energy change?",It doubles,It quadruples,It remains constant,It halves,B,"Since E = ½·k·A², doubling A results in 4 times the energy: (2A)² = 4A²."
Which parameter has no effect on total energy in ideal SHM?,Amplitude,Spring constant,Mass,Displacement,C,"Total energy in SHM depends on amplitude and spring constant: E = ½·k·A². Mass affects frequency, not energy."
What is true about mass in relation to total energy in SHM?,It increases energy linearly,It determines amplitude,It does not directly affect total energy,It determines total energy in all cases,C,"Mass affects motion and period, but total energy in SHM is based on amplitude and spring constant."
Which change results in a greater total energy in SHM?,Doubling the mass,Doubling the amplitude,Halving the spring constant,Increasing velocity,B,Energy is E = ½·k·A². Doubling amplitude causes energy to increase by a factor of 4.
"If a mass is moved to a stiffer spring with the same amplitude, what happens to total energy?",It decreases,It stays the same,It increases,It becomes zero,C,Energy depends on k and A: E = ½·k·A². Increasing k increases energy.
"In SHM, what role does mass primarily play?",It determines total energy,It affects frequency and period,It controls amplitude,It changes energy directly,B,"Mass influences period/frequency via T = 2·π·√(m/k), not total energy."
How can two SHM systems with the same mass have different energies?,If their spring constants or amplitudes differ,If one is at rest,If mass changes midway,They can’t,A,"E = ½·k·A² — energy is affected by system parameters like spring constant and amplitude, not mass alone."
Why might a student mistakenly believe mass determines SHM energy?,They confuse KE = ½·m·v² with total energy,They think mass controls displacement,They assume heavier objects always have more energy,All of the above,D,"Students may conflate mass’s role in kinetic energy and frequency with its role in total SHM energy, which is actually determined by k and A."
