Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says energy is lost during SHM. What is the correct idea for ideal SHM?,Energy gradually decreases with each swing,Total energy remains constant over time,Energy is only conserved at equilibrium,Energy disappears at maximum displacement,B,"In ideal SHM (no damping), mechanical energy is conserved. The sum of kinetic and potential energy remains constant."
Which statement is true about energy in undamped SHM?,Only potential energy exists,Kinetic energy stays constant,"Total energy is constant, but kinetic and potential energy vary",Energy flows out of the system,C,"In SHM, energy transforms between kinetic and potential forms, but total mechanical energy remains unchanged."
What happens to total energy in SHM if no friction or damping is present?,It slowly decreases,It remains constant,It increases each cycle,It fluctuates randomly,B,"In ideal SHM, energy is conserved. The mechanical energy (E = K + U) remains constant without energy loss."
Where is kinetic energy at its maximum in SHM?,At maximum displacement,At equilibrium,At turning points,At all times,B,Kinetic energy is greatest at equilibrium because velocity is maximum and potential energy is zero there.
Where is potential energy at its maximum in SHM?,At equilibrium,At maximum velocity,At maximum displacement,At zero velocity,C,Potential energy U = ½·k·x² is highest when displacement (x) is maximum.
What causes energy to appear 'lost' in non-ideal SHM?,Spring stiffness,Mass increase,Damping forces like friction,More displacement,C,"Damping converts mechanical energy into thermal energy or sound, reducing amplitude over time."
How does an energy vs. time graph look in ideal SHM?,Total energy decreases steadily,Total energy stays constant,Kinetic energy is always zero,Energy never changes form,B,"In ideal SHM, total mechanical energy is conserved. Kinetic and potential energies vary sinusoidally, but their sum remains fixed."
"If amplitude increases in SHM, what happens to total energy?",It stays the same,It increases,It decreases,It becomes undefined,B,Total mechanical energy in SHM is proportional to A² (E = ½·k·A²). So increasing amplitude increases energy.
"In SHM, what is always true regardless of time?",Displacement is constant,Kinetic energy is constant,Mechanical energy is conserved,Acceleration is maximum,C,Mechanical energy (K + U) is constant in undamped SHM — the defining trait of ideal systems.
Why does total mechanical energy remain constant in SHM?,Because energy cannot transform,Because the mass never moves,Because energy shifts between kinetic and potential without loss,Because velocity is constant,C,"As the object oscillates, energy converts back and forth between kinetic and potential. No external work means no energy loss."
