Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student claims that KE and PE are both maximum at the same time in SHM. What is the correct understanding?,They peak together at equilibrium,They are both zero at equilibrium,They trade off — one is max when the other is zero,They remain constant throughout,C,"In SHM, total energy is conserved, and KE and PE continuously transform into one another. KE is max when PE is zero and vice versa."
When is potential energy maximum in SHM?,At equilibrium,At maximum velocity,At maximum displacement,At the midpoint,C,"U = ½·k·x² is maximum when displacement (x) is maximum, which occurs at the turning points of motion."
When is kinetic energy maximum in SHM?,At maximum displacement,At equilibrium,At zero velocity,At minimum displacement,B,KE = ½·m·v² is maximum when velocity is highest — which occurs at the equilibrium point where displacement is zero.
Which best describes the energy transformations in SHM?,KE and PE increase together,KE and PE are both constant,Energy oscillates between KE and PE,Only KE exists,C,"Mechanical energy is conserved in SHM, with continuous conversion between kinetic and potential forms."
What is true about total energy in SHM?,It is maximum at equilibrium,It varies with position,It remains constant,It is zero at turning points,C,Total mechanical energy remains constant in ideal SHM: E = KE + PE = constant.
Which graph best represents KE and PE in SHM over time?,Two constant lines,Two sine waves peaking at the same time,Two sine waves 180° out of phase,"One flat, one exponential",C,KE and PE oscillate sinusoidally and are completely out of phase — one peaks when the other is zero.
"If potential energy is zero in SHM, what is true about kinetic energy?",It is zero,It is also zero,It is at maximum,It is undefined,C,"When PE is zero (x = 0), all energy is kinetic — KE is at maximum at equilibrium."
What happens to kinetic energy as the object approaches maximum displacement?,It increases,It becomes constant,It decreases to zero,It stays at max,C,"As the object reaches the end of its swing, it slows down. Velocity reaches zero, and so does KE."
Why do KE and PE not peak at the same time in SHM?,Because they represent different objects,Because energy must be lost,Because they convert into each other — their phases are opposite,Because SHM is random,C,"In ideal SHM, KE and PE transform back and forth. When one is at a maximum, the other is at zero."
"If kinetic energy is maximum, what is true about the object’s position?",It is at maximum displacement,It is halfway to max displacement,It is at equilibrium,It is not moving,C,Maximum KE occurs when the object moves fastest — at equilibrium where x = 0 and PE = 0.
