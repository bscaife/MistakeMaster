Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says amplitude doesn't affect energy in SHM. What’s the correct understanding?,Energy depends only on mass,Energy is constant no matter the motion,Total energy in SHM depends on the square of amplitude,Energy depends on frequency only,C,Total energy in SHM is E = ½·k·A². The energy increases with the square of the amplitude.
Which equation correctly shows how amplitude affects energy in SHM?,E = ½·m·v²,E = ½·k·x²,E = ½·k·A²,E = m·g·h,C,Total energy in SHM is proportional to amplitude squared: E = ½·k·A².
What happens to the total energy if amplitude in SHM is doubled?,It stays the same,It doubles,It increases by a factor of 4,It decreases,C,"E = ½·k·A². Doubling A means energy increases by A² → (2A)² = 4A², so energy quadruples."
What causes the greatest increase in energy in an SHM system?,Increasing mass,Increasing amplitude,Decreasing spring constant,Reducing displacement,B,"Since E = ½·k·A², increasing A has a quadratic effect on total energy, the most impactful change."
Why does amplitude affect the energy in SHM?,Because it increases velocity,Because energy is stored in motion,Because potential energy depends on max displacement,Because energy is related to period,C,"Potential energy U = ½·k·x² reaches its maximum at amplitude A, so total energy scales with A²."
Which change would increase the total energy of an SHM system the most?,Doubling the amplitude,Halving the spring constant,Reducing the mass,Shortening the time period,A,"Because E ∝ A², doubling amplitude causes a fourfold increase in energy — more than any other listed change."
"If a mass oscillates with greater amplitude, what happens to the total mechanical energy?",It stays the same,It increases,It decreases,It becomes undefined,B,"As amplitude increases, total mechanical energy increases due to E = ½·k·A²."
Which of the following quantities is directly related to amplitude in SHM?,Frequency,Period,Total mechanical energy,Spring constant,C,"Amplitude does not affect period or frequency, but it directly affects energy: E = ½·k·A²."
What happens to total energy in SHM if amplitude is cut in half?,It is halved,It remains unchanged,It is reduced to one-fourth,It increases,C,"E ∝ A². If A becomes ½·A, then E = ½·k·(½·A)² = ¼·(½·k·A²). Energy becomes one-fourth."
Which feature of SHM energy graphs reflects the role of amplitude?,Frequency peaks,Energy wave symmetry,Height of energy curves relates to A²,Flat lines for KE and PE,C,"Total mechanical energy is proportional to A², so the height (amplitude) of energy graphs reflects this dependence."
