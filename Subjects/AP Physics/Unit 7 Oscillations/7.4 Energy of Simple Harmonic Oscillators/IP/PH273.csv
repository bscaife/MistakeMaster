Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student draws linear energy-time graphs for SHM. What’s incorrect about this?,Energy is constant in SHM,Energy graphs should be exponential,KE and PE vary sinusoidally in SHM,Only total energy changes over time,C,"In SHM, KE and PE oscillate with time in a sinusoidal pattern. Linear energy graphs are incorrect unless total energy is being plotted as a constant."
Which graph correctly represents kinetic energy over time in SHM?,A sinusoidal wave with two peaks per period,A straight diagonal line,A constant flat line,An exponential curve,A,"Kinetic energy varies with the square of the cosine of angular frequency, which produces a sinusoidal shape that peaks twice per cycle."
Which graph best represents potential energy in SHM?,A linear increasing line,A sine wave 180° out of phase with KE,A constant line,A parabola,B,"PE and KE are sinusoidal and out of phase in SHM. When KE is max, PE is zero, and vice versa."
What does the total energy graph look like in ideal SHM?,Linearly increasing,Constant horizontal line,Sinusoidal curve,Zig-zag function,B,"In ideal SHM, total mechanical energy is constant over time and appears as a flat line on a graph."
What causes KE and PE to change shape over time in SHM?,Amplitude remains constant,Velocity and displacement vary sinusoidally,Damping forces change direction,Spring constant changes,B,"Since KE = ½·m·v² and PE = ½·k·x², and both v and x are sinusoidal, the energies change sinusoidally too."
Why might a student mistakenly draw linear energy graphs for SHM?,They confuse energy with displacement,They think velocity is constant,They overlook sinusoidal variation of motion,All of the above,D,"Misunderstanding the nature of SHM can lead to incorrect linear interpretations of energy change, when it’s actually sinusoidal."
"If a mass on a spring is oscillating, what happens to KE over time?",It stays constant,It varies sinusoidally,It increases linearly,It decays exponentially,B,"KE is proportional to v², and velocity in SHM varies sinusoidally, making KE a sinusoidal function of time."
When does kinetic energy reach zero in SHM?,At equilibrium,At all times,At maximum displacement,When mass is increased,C,"Velocity is zero at max displacement, so KE = 0 there. This is a repeated, sinusoidal pattern."
Which of these is always true in ideal SHM?,KE + PE = constant,KE and PE always rise together,KE is always greater than PE,Energy is lost over time,A,"In undamped SHM, mechanical energy is conserved. KE and PE vary, but their sum remains constant."
What is the shape of a KE vs. time graph in SHM if plotted over several cycles?,Flat horizontal line,Symmetric sinusoidal curve with peaks at equilibrium,Linearly increasing ramp,Inverted parabolas,B,"KE peaks at equilibrium, drops to zero at max displacement, and repeats — forming a sinusoidal pattern."
