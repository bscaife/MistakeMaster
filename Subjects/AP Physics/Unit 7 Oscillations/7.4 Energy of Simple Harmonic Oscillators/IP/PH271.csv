Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says kinetic energy is constant in SHM. What is the correct understanding?,Kinetic energy stays constant throughout the cycle,Kinetic energy is only zero at equilibrium,Kinetic energy varies and is maximum at equilibrium,Kinetic energy is equal to potential energy at all times,C,"Kinetic energy KE = ½·m·v² varies with velocity, which changes during SHM. It reaches a maximum at equilibrium where velocity is greatest."
What is true about KE in SHM?,It is constant for all positions,It increases as the object moves away from equilibrium,It decreases to zero at the turning points,It is always equal to total energy,C,"At the turning points (maximum displacement), velocity is zero, so KE = 0."
When is kinetic energy maximum in SHM?,At maximum displacement,At equilibrium,At the midpoint between equilibrium and max displacement,At rest,B,"Kinetic energy is maximum when velocity is maximum, which occurs at the equilibrium point (x = 0)."
Why does kinetic energy change in SHM?,Because mass changes,Because velocity varies throughout the motion,Because time affects energy directly,Because position stays constant,B,"Since KE = ½·m·v² and v changes sinusoidally in SHM, kinetic energy changes with time and position."
What happens to KE as the object moves from equilibrium to maximum displacement?,KE increases,KE stays the same,KE decreases,KE becomes negative,C,"As the object slows down toward the turning point, velocity decreases and KE decreases, reaching zero at max displacement."
Which graph best represents kinetic energy over time in ideal SHM?,A constant flat line,A sine wave in phase with displacement,A sinusoidal curve peaking at equilibrium,A linear curve,C,"KE varies with v², and v is a cosine wave shifted from displacement. KE peaks at equilibrium and drops to zero at turning points."
What does the variation in kinetic energy during SHM indicate about the motion?,The object moves at constant speed,The speed varies throughout the cycle,The object stops permanently at the ends,The energy is not conserved,B,"As KE changes, it reflects changing speed of the object. Velocity is highest at equilibrium and zero at max displacement."
"If the object in SHM is at its maximum displacement, what is its kinetic energy?",Maximum,Half the total energy,Zero,Constant,C,"At maximum displacement, velocity is zero. Since KE = ½·m·v², KE is also zero there."
What happens to the kinetic energy after the object passes through equilibrium in SHM?,It remains unchanged,It becomes potential energy,It begins to decrease,It disappears,C,"After passing equilibrium, the object slows as it approaches maximum displacement, so KE decreases."
Why might someone incorrectly assume KE is constant in SHM?,They mistake constant total energy for constant KE,They confuse SHM with linear motion,They think the object is always at rest,They ignore displacement entirely,A,"In SHM, total mechanical energy is constant, but KE and PE oscillate. Confusing total energy with KE leads to this misconception."
