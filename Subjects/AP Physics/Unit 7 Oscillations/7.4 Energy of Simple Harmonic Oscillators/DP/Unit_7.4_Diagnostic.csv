A uniform solid sphere of mass m and radius R rolls without slipping down an incline of height h. What is its speed at the bottom?,C,v = √(2gh),FALSE,PH238,v = √(gh),FALSE,PH234,v = √(10/7·gh),TRUE,,v = √(4/3·gh),FALSE,PH236,"Use energy conservation: mgh = ½·m·v² + ½·I·ω², with I = 2/5·m·R² and ω = v/R. Substitution: mgh = ½·m·v² + ½·(2/5·m·R²)·(v²/R²) = ½·m·v² + 1/5·m·v² = 7/10·m·v². Solving: v² = 10/7·gh, so v = √(10/7·gh)."
A hoop of radius R and mass m rolls without slipping. Its kinetic energy is…,B,Only translational: ½·m·v²,FALSE,PH234,Both rotational and translational: ½·m·v² + ½·I·ω²,TRUE,,Only rotational: ½·I·ω²,FALSE,PH236,"Neither, because rolling cancels",FALSE,PH235,"Total energy = translational + rotational. For hoop, I = m·R², so KE = ½·m·v² + ½·(m·R²)·(v²/R²) = ½·m·v² + ½·m·v² = m·v²."
A cylinder of mass m rolls down a ramp. Which force enables rolling without slipping?,D,Normal force,FALSE,PH236,Gravity alone,FALSE,PH237,Friction force,FALSE,PH235,Static friction,TRUE,,"Rolling requires static friction to prevent slipping. Normal force and gravity act, but only static friction provides the torque needed for rolling without slipping."
A solid disk and a hoop of equal mass and radius roll down the same incline. Which reaches the bottom first?,A,Solid disk,TRUE,,Hoop,FALSE,PH238,Both at same time,FALSE,PH236,"Neither, depends only on mass",FALSE,PH234,"Acceleration depends on I. Disk has I = ½·m·R², hoop has I = m·R². a = g·sinθ / (1 + I/mR²). Disk denominator 1.5 < hoop denominator 2, so disk accelerates faster."
"If a rolling object has zero friction, what happens?",B,It still rolls without slipping,FALSE,PH237,It slips instead of rolling,TRUE,,It stops moving,FALSE,PH236,It accelerates faster,FALSE,PH238,"Without friction, there is no torque to produce rolling. The object will slide without rolling, so it slips."
What is the condition for rolling without slipping?,D,F = m·a,FALSE,PH236,v = a·t,FALSE,PH237,I·α = τ,FALSE,PH235,a₍cₘ₎ = α·R,TRUE,,Rolling without slipping requires the center of mass acceleration and angular acceleration to be linked: a₍cₘ₎ = α·R. This ensures the point of contact does not slip.
A solid sphere and a cylinder roll from rest down identical ramps of height h. Which has greater final speed?,C,They tie,FALSE,PH238,Sphere,FALSE,PH236,Same final speed,TRUE,,Cylinder,FALSE,PH234,"Energy conservation gives mgh = ½·m·v² + ½·I·ω². Both sphere and cylinder convert all mgh into KE. Despite different accelerations, final speeds depend only on h, so both have v = √(2gh)."
Which statement about rolling energy is correct?,A,Total KE = ½·m·v² + ½·I·ω²,TRUE,,Translational KE only,FALSE,PH234,Rotational KE only,FALSE,PH236,KE = m·gh always,FALSE,PH238,"For rolling motion, KE includes both translational and rotational parts. With v = ω·R, KE total = ½·m·v² + ½·I·ω²."
A cylinder rolls up a ramp with speed v. What happens at its highest point?,D,All KE remains translational,FALSE,PH234,All KE remains rotational,FALSE,PH236,It stops instantly with no energy,FALSE,PH235,KE converts to potential energy,FALSE,PH238,"Energy conservation: initial KE = ½·m·v² + ½·I·ω² converts to mgh. At top, v = 0, ω = 0, so all KE becomes gravitational potential."
A bowling ball rolls without slipping on a lane. Which equation links linear and angular speed?,B,a = g·sinθ,FALSE,PH236,v = ω·R,TRUE,,F = m·a,FALSE,PH237,I = ½·m·R²,FALSE,PH234,"Rolling without slipping requires v = ω·R, relating translational and rotational motion directly."
