"In SHM, when displacement is maximum, what is velocity?",A,Zero,TRUE,,Maximum,FALSE,PH261,Constant,FALSE,PH260,Increasing,FALSE,PH260,Velocity is zero at maximum displacement because the object changes direction.
When is velocity maximum in SHM?,B,At maximum displacement,FALSE,PH261,At the equilibrium position,TRUE,,Velocity is constant,FALSE,PH262,Halfway between extremes,FALSE,PH260,Velocity peaks at equilibrium when all energy is kinetic.
What is true about acceleration in SHM?,C,It is constant,FALSE,PH262,It varies with velocity,FALSE,PH260,It varies with displacement,TRUE,,It is always maximum,FALSE,PH262,"Acceleration a = -(k/m)x, so it depends on displacement."
Which SHM graph shows velocity leading displacement by 90째?,D,Any SHM graphs can be interchanged,FALSE,PH263,They are always in phase,FALSE,PH260,Graphs are identical,FALSE,PH263,A velocity-time graph compared to displacement-time,TRUE,,Velocity and displacement graphs are out of phase by 90째 in SHM.
"If acceleration is zero in SHM, what is displacement?",A,Zero,TRUE,,Maximum,FALSE,PH260,Halfway to max,FALSE,PH260,It depends on velocity,FALSE,PH260,Acceleration is zero at equilibrium where displacement is zero.
"When displacement is zero in SHM, what is acceleration?",B,Maximum,FALSE,PH262,Zero,TRUE,,Constant,FALSE,PH262,Half maximum,FALSE,PH260,"At equilibrium, acceleration is zero and velocity is maximum."
"In SHM, how do displacement, velocity, and acceleration reach zero?",C,They are all zero together,FALSE,PH264,Velocity and acceleration are zero together,FALSE,PH264,They do not all reach zero simultaneously,TRUE,,Displacement and acceleration are zero together,FALSE,PH264,Only one quantity is zero at a given instant; they are out of phase.
"When velocity is zero in SHM, acceleration is:",D,Zero,FALSE,PH260,Constant,FALSE,PH262,Half maximum,FALSE,PH260,Maximum,TRUE,,Velocity is zero at extremes where acceleration magnitude is maximum.
What is the phase relationship between acceleration and displacement in SHM?,A,They are in phase,TRUE,,They are out of phase by 90째,FALSE,PH263,They are unrelated,FALSE,PH260,Acceleration leads displacement by 180째,FALSE,PH263,Acceleration and displacement vary together with opposite signs in SHM.
