Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH260,"Displacement, velocity, and acceleration are all in sync","Fails to recognize that in SHM, displacement is maximum when velocity is zero, and acceleration is not synchronized with velocity."
PH261,Velocity is always greatest at the maximum displacement,"Thinks the object moves fastest at the ends, rather than at the equilibrium position where kinetic energy is maximum."
PH262,Acceleration is constant in SHM,"Assumes constant acceleration throughout the motion, ignoring its dependence on displacement (a ∝ –x)."
PH263,Graphs of SHM quantities are interchangeable,"Confuses the phase relationships between displacement, velocity, and acceleration graphs in simple harmonic motion."
PH264,All zero values occur at the same time,"Believes displacement, velocity, and acceleration are zero simultaneously, not understanding their sinusoidal relationship."
PH265,SHM graphs are symmetrical around the x-axis,Fails to distinguish between amplitude-based symmetry and offset trends caused by damping or non-ideal behavior.
PH266,Acceleration is highest at equilibrium,Misunderstands that acceleration is zero at equilibrium and greatest at maximum displacement.
