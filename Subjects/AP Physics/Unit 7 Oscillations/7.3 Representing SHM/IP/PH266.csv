Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says acceleration is highest at equilibrium in SHM. What’s the correct understanding?,Acceleration is always highest at x = 0,Acceleration is constant throughout motion,Acceleration is zero at equilibrium and greatest at max displacement,Acceleration is unrelated to position,C,"In SHM, acceleration is a = -k·x/m, so it’s zero at equilibrium (x = 0) and maximum when displacement is greatest (x = ±A)."
Where is acceleration greatest in SHM?,At equilibrium,At maximum displacement,At half amplitude,Acceleration is constant,B,"Acceleration is proportional to displacement: a = -k·x/m, so it is greatest in magnitude when x is at its maximum."
What happens to acceleration at equilibrium in SHM?,It is at a maximum,It equals velocity,It is zero,It is undefined,C,"At x = 0, a = -k·x/m = 0. So acceleration is zero at the equilibrium position."
Why is acceleration not maximum at the center of SHM motion?,Because velocity is zero there,Because acceleration only exists at the ends,Because acceleration is zero at equilibrium where x = 0,Because motion stops there,C,"Acceleration is proportional to displacement (a = -k·x/m), and displacement is zero at equilibrium, so acceleration is zero there too."
Which graph of acceleration vs. time in SHM is correct?,A horizontal line,A sine wave in phase with velocity,A cosine wave 180° out of phase with displacement,A linear graph,C,"Acceleration in SHM is sinusoidal and 180° out of phase with displacement, since a = -k·x/m."
What causes maximum acceleration in SHM?,High speed,Zero net force,Large displacement,Low energy,C,"Acceleration depends on displacement: a = -k·x/m. The larger the displacement, the larger the restoring force and acceleration."
"In SHM, what occurs at the equilibrium point?",Maximum displacement and acceleration,Zero velocity and zero acceleration,Maximum velocity and zero acceleration,Maximum acceleration and zero velocity,C,"At equilibrium, displacement and acceleration are zero, while velocity is at its maximum."
When does acceleration equal zero in SHM?,When displacement is maximum,When velocity is zero,When the object crosses equilibrium,Always,C,"At x = 0, a = -k·x/m = 0. Acceleration is zero when the object passes through equilibrium."
What determines the acceleration in a mass-spring SHM system?,Amplitude only,Speed of the object,Displacement from equilibrium,Time alone,C,"In SHM, acceleration is directly proportional to displacement: a = -k·x/m."
Why is acceleration not greatest at x = 0 in SHM?,Because x = 0 means a = 0,Because energy is constant,Because force is infinite there,Because speed is zero there,A,"Acceleration in SHM is based on position: a = -k·x/m. At x = 0, this results in a = 0."
