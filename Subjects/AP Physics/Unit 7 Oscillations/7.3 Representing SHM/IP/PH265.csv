Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says SHM graphs are symmetrical around the x-axis. What is incorrect about that?,All SHM graphs are flat,Only damped motion is symmetrical,"SHM graphs are symmetrical around the equilibrium line, not the x-axis",SHM graphs never repeat,C,"In SHM, graphs like displacement vs. time are symmetric about the equilibrium position (x = 0), not the x-axis itself unless the axis is defined that way."
Which graph is truly symmetric about the equilibrium position in SHM?,Displacement vs. time,Velocity vs. time,Acceleration vs. time,All of the above,D,All ideal SHM graphs are sinusoidal and symmetric around their equilibrium (midline) values.
What makes a SHM graph appear asymmetrical in a real-world setting?,Perfect spring constant,Phase shift,Damping or friction,High frequency,C,"Non-ideal conditions like damping reduce amplitude over time, breaking the symmetry seen in ideal SHM."
What happens to a position vs. time SHM graph under damping?,It remains a perfect sine wave,It becomes constant,The amplitude decreases over time,It becomes linear,C,"Damping causes amplitude to decay over time, leading to an envelope that narrows — symmetry is no longer consistent."
"In ideal SHM, which axis is the symmetry centered around?",The x-axis,The time axis,The equilibrium value (x = 0),The acceleration axis,C,"SHM oscillates symmetrically around the equilibrium position, not necessarily around the x-axis unless defined that way."
Which feature of an SHM graph remains symmetric in the absence of damping?,Peak acceleration only,Amplitude and period,Graph curvature,Velocity zero crossings,B,"Ideal SHM has constant amplitude and period, resulting in symmetric oscillation around the equilibrium point."
Why might a student incorrectly claim symmetry around the x-axis in SHM?,They assume x always equals zero,They confuse axis with equilibrium line,They only view positive motion,They ignore velocity,B,Students may confuse the x-axis (graph reference) with the physical equilibrium line about which SHM is symmetric.
Which of the following breaks symmetry in an SHM graph?,Lower spring constant,Increased mass,Damping force like friction,Increased amplitude,C,Friction or damping introduces asymmetry by causing the amplitude to decay over time.
What distinguishes SHM from damped motion graphically?,Only SHM repeats identically over time,Damped motion stays symmetric,SHM never reaches equilibrium,Only damped motion is sinusoidal,A,"In ideal SHM, the motion is periodic and symmetric. Damped motion loses amplitude and doesn’t repeat identically."
What is the typical shape of a position vs. time graph in SHM?,Straight line,Parabola,Sine wave centered on the equilibrium line,Symmetric wave centered on the x-axis,C,"Displacement over time in SHM forms a sine wave that oscillates around x = 0, not necessarily the x-axis itself."
