Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student claims acceleration is constant in SHM. What is the correct understanding?,Acceleration is always zero,Acceleration increases with velocity,Acceleration depends on position: a ∝ –x,Acceleration is constant during each half cycle,C,"In SHM, acceleration is proportional to the negative of displacement: a = -k·x/m. It varies depending on position."
Which of the following best describes acceleration in SHM?,Constant in magnitude,Always directed away from equilibrium,Proportional to displacement from equilibrium,Always directed forward,C,Acceleration follows a = -k·x/m in SHM. It increases with displacement and always points toward the center.
When is acceleration greatest in SHM?,At equilibrium,At maximum velocity,At maximum displacement,At all points equally,C,Acceleration a = -k·x/m is largest when x is largest — at the turning points.
At which point in SHM is acceleration zero?,At maximum displacement,At equilibrium,At the peak of velocity,At the midpoint of each half swing,B,"Acceleration is zero at equilibrium (x = 0), since a = -k·x/m and x = 0 there."
How does acceleration change as an object moves from maximum displacement to equilibrium in SHM?,It stays constant,It increases,It decreases to zero,It becomes infinite,C,"As x decreases toward 0, a = -k·x/m also decreases toward 0. So acceleration fades as the object nears equilibrium."
Which formula defines the acceleration in a mass-spring system undergoing SHM?,a = -k·x/m,a = -v/t,a = F/m,a = constant,A,Acceleration in SHM is position-dependent and given by a = -k·x/m.
Why is it incorrect to say acceleration is constant in SHM?,Because SHM is random,Because force changes direction,Because acceleration varies with position,Because equilibrium has zero energy,C,"In SHM, a = -k·x/m — acceleration depends directly on displacement, not time alone."
Which of these SHM graphs would show how acceleration varies?,A flat horizontal line,A sine wave,A straight diagonal line,A cosine curve with negative sign,D,Acceleration in SHM is sinusoidal and out of phase with displacement. It's typically shown as a negative cosine function.
"If an object in SHM has a displacement of zero, what is true about its acceleration?",Acceleration is at a maximum,Acceleration is zero,Acceleration is opposite velocity,Acceleration is equal to velocity,B,"At equilibrium (x = 0), a = -k·x/m = 0, so acceleration is zero there."
In what way is SHM different from constant acceleration motion?,Acceleration never changes in SHM,SHM includes increasing mass,Acceleration in SHM varies with displacement,SHM doesn’t follow Newton’s laws,C,"Unlike uniform acceleration motion, SHM has a = -k·x/m, which varies as the position of the object changes."
