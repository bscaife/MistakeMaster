Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"A student claims that displacement, velocity, and acceleration all reach their maximum at the same time in SHM. What is the truth?",They all peak together,Velocity and displacement peak together,Displacement is maximum when velocity is zero,Acceleration and velocity peak together,C,"In SHM, displacement is maximum at turning points where velocity is zero. Velocity is maximum at equilibrium, where displacement is zero."
When is acceleration maximum in SHM?,When velocity is maximum,When displacement is zero,When displacement is maximum,When velocity and displacement match,C,Acceleration is a = -k·x/m. It’s largest in magnitude when x is largest — at maximum displacement.
At which point is velocity zero in SHM?,When displacement is zero,When acceleration is zero,When displacement is maximum,When acceleration is maximum,C,"At the turning points of SHM, displacement is maximum and velocity is zero."
When does an object in SHM experience zero acceleration?,When velocity is zero,When displacement is maximum,When velocity is maximum,At all points in motion,C,"Acceleration a = -k·x/m. When displacement x = 0 (equilibrium), acceleration is zero and velocity is maximum."
What is the relationship between displacement and velocity in SHM?,They are maximum together,Velocity is maximum when displacement is maximum,Velocity is maximum when displacement is zero,They always point in the same direction,C,Velocity is greatest at the equilibrium point (x = 0) and zero at max displacement.
When is acceleration zero in simple harmonic motion?,When velocity is zero,When displacement is maximum,When displacement is zero,When all other values are also zero,C,"Acceleration a = -k·x/m. It becomes zero when x = 0, i.e., at equilibrium."
Which of the following is true for SHM?,Displacement and velocity peak at the same time,Velocity is zero when displacement is maximum,Acceleration is constant,Displacement is zero when velocity is zero,B,"At the ends of SHM motion, displacement is max, but object is momentarily at rest, so velocity is zero."
How are displacement and acceleration related in SHM?,They peak at different times,They are out of phase,They are proportional but opposite in direction,They are unrelated,C,Acceleration a = -k·x/m shows that acceleration and displacement are directly proportional but have opposite signs.
Which phase relationship is correct for SHM quantities?,Displacement and velocity are in phase,Velocity and acceleration peak together,Displacement and acceleration peak together,All are synchronized,C,"Acceleration is a = -k·x/m, so both displacement and acceleration reach max at the same time, but in opposite directions."
Why is it incorrect to say all motion variables peak together in SHM?,Because SHM only involves velocity,Because they peak at different positions due to phase differences,Because velocity and acceleration cancel,Because time is not a factor,B,"Displacement, velocity, and acceleration vary sinusoidally with time, but with phase differences — they do not peak together."
