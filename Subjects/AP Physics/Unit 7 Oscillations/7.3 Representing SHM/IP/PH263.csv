Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"A student says that displacement, velocity, and acceleration graphs in SHM all look the same. What is incorrect about this?",They all have the same frequency,They are out of phase with each other,They are all sine waves of different amplitude,They overlap at maximum points,B,"SHM graphs have the same shape (sinusoidal) but are out of phase: velocity leads displacement by 90°, acceleration by 180°."
Which SHM graph peaks when displacement is zero?,Displacement,Velocity,Acceleration,Force,B,"Velocity is maximum at x = 0, the equilibrium point. This corresponds to the midpoint of the displacement graph."
Which SHM graph is 180° out of phase with displacement?,Velocity,Energy,Acceleration,Mass,C,"Acceleration is a = -k·x/m, meaning it is directly opposite in sign and phase to displacement at all times."
"If displacement is a sine function, which of the following describes velocity in SHM?","Another sine wave, in phase",A sine wave shifted by 90°,A constant,An exponential decay,B,"Velocity leads displacement by 90° in phase, so its graph is a sine wave shifted by ¼ of the period."
What kind of function describes acceleration in SHM?,It matches displacement exactly,It is opposite in phase to displacement,It matches velocity,It’s a cosine with zero phase shift,B,Acceleration and displacement are out of phase by 180° because a = -k·x/m.
How are the displacement and velocity graphs related in SHM?,They are identical in shape and phase,They are sine waves with a 90° phase shift,Velocity has twice the amplitude,Velocity graph is flat,B,"Velocity leads displacement by a quarter cycle (90°), meaning they peak at different times."
What is true about the shapes of SHM graphs?,Displacement and acceleration are in phase,All are sine waves but with different phase relationships,Velocity is constant,Acceleration always matches velocity,B,"Displacement, velocity, and acceleration all have sinusoidal forms, but they are shifted in time (phase) relative to each other."
Which statement best describes SHM graph relationships?,All quantities are synchronized,Displacement and acceleration are out of phase,Velocity and displacement always cross zero together,Acceleration leads velocity by 90°,B,"Since a = -k·x/m, acceleration and displacement are mirror images in time (180° out of phase)."
"At the moment displacement is zero in SHM, what is true about acceleration?",It is also zero,It is maximum,It is undefined,It is at equilibrium,A,"At x = 0, acceleration a = -k·x/m is zero because the restoring force is zero at equilibrium."
Why can SHM graphs not be used interchangeably?,They are all in different units,They represent different physical concepts with distinct phase shifts,They are always straight lines,Only velocity matters in SHM,B,"Each SHM graph represents a different quantity (x, v, a) and each is phase-shifted relative to the others."
