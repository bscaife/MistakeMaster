Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"A student says displacement, velocity, and acceleration are all zero at the same time in SHM. What’s wrong with this claim?",They never reach zero in SHM,They all peak at different times,They follow sinusoidal relationships with different phases,Only velocity can be zero in SHM,C,"In SHM, x, v, and a are all sinusoidal but out of phase. Displacement is zero when velocity is max, and acceleration is zero at the same time, not all three simultaneously."
When is velocity zero in SHM?,At equilibrium,At max displacement,At max acceleration,At zero acceleration,B,"At max displacement, the object reverses direction. Velocity is zero there."
What is true about acceleration in SHM when displacement is zero?,Acceleration is zero,Acceleration is at maximum,Acceleration is constant,Acceleration equals velocity,A,"a = -k·x/m. When x = 0, acceleration is also 0. So displacement and acceleration are zero together, not with velocity."
What is the value of velocity in SHM when displacement is zero?,It is zero,It is maximum,It is constant,It is minimum,B,Velocity is maximum at x = 0 because the object is passing through equilibrium at peak speed.
What is true when velocity is zero in SHM?,Displacement and acceleration are both zero,Displacement is zero and acceleration is maximum,Displacement is maximum and acceleration is maximum,Acceleration is zero and displacement is maximum,C,"At the turning point, the object is momentarily stopped (v = 0), at max x, and max restoring force = max acceleration."
Which of the following is correct in SHM?,All variables reach zero at the same time,Velocity is maximum when displacement and acceleration are zero,Displacement is always zero when velocity is zero,Velocity and acceleration peak together,B,"Displacement and acceleration are zero at x = 0, where velocity is maximum."
What happens to velocity when both displacement and acceleration are zero in SHM?,Velocity is also zero,Velocity is maximum,Velocity is undefined,Velocity is negative,B,"When x = 0 and a = 0, the object is passing through equilibrium, so velocity is at its maximum."
Why don’t all SHM quantities hit zero together?,Because SHM isn’t periodic,Because they peak at different times due to phase shifts,Because only displacement can be zero,Because acceleration is always zero,B,"SHM quantities vary sinusoidally with distinct phase shifts, so they do not all reach zero simultaneously."
Which graph quantities are zero at the same instant in SHM?,Velocity and displacement,Displacement and acceleration,Velocity and acceleration,All of them,B,Displacement and acceleration are both zero at equilibrium. Velocity is not — it is maximum there.
"If displacement is at a maximum, what is true about velocity and acceleration?",Both are zero,"Velocity is maximum, acceleration is zero","Velocity is zero, acceleration is maximum",All are at maximum,C,"At max displacement, the object is stopped (v = 0) and has the greatest restoring force, hence max acceleration."
