Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says the object moves fastest at the ends of its motion in SHM. What is the correct statement?,The object is fastest at maximum displacement,The object moves fastest at equilibrium,The object has no speed at equilibrium,The speed is always the same,B,"In SHM, velocity is maximum at the equilibrium point where displacement is zero and all energy is kinetic: v₍max₎ at x = 0."
Where does maximum velocity occur in simple harmonic motion?,At maximum displacement,Halfway to the equilibrium point,At the equilibrium point,At the turnaround point,C,Velocity peaks at x = 0 because that's where the object has zero potential energy and maximum kinetic energy.
What happens to the velocity at maximum displacement in SHM?,It reaches maximum,It is zero,It becomes negative,It fluctuates,B,"At maximum displacement (±A), the object changes direction, so its instantaneous velocity is zero."
Why is kinetic energy greatest at equilibrium in SHM?,Because the object is farthest from rest,Because the restoring force is zero,Because velocity is maximum,Because acceleration is maximum,C,"Kinetic energy is K = ½·m·v². Since v is largest at x = 0, kinetic energy peaks at the equilibrium position."
Which graph correctly shows velocity in SHM as the object passes through equilibrium?,Velocity is minimum,Velocity is zero,Velocity is maximum,Velocity is undefined,C,"Velocity is maximum at equilibrium, not at the ends. This is where the object is moving fastest."
What is true about the motion of an object at the maximum displacement in SHM?,Velocity is greatest,Acceleration is zero,Velocity is zero,Kinetic energy is maximum,C,"At the maximum displacement, the object is instantaneously at rest before reversing direction, so v = 0."
At what position is the potential energy of a spring-mass system greatest?,At equilibrium,At maximum velocity,At maximum displacement,At minimum displacement,C,"Potential energy U = ½·k·x² is greatest when x is greatest — that is, at maximum displacement."
Which of the following statements is correct in SHM?,Velocity and displacement peak together,Velocity is zero when acceleration is zero,"Velocity is maximum at equilibrium, zero at max displacement",Velocity is constant throughout,C,"In SHM, v = ω·√(A² - x²), so v is max when x = 0 and v = 0 when x = ±A."
How does energy help explain velocity behavior in SHM?,All energy is always kinetic,Velocity is maximum where energy is all potential,Kinetic energy is maximum at max displacement,Kinetic energy is maximum when displacement is zero,D,"At equilibrium (x = 0), all energy is kinetic. That’s when velocity is highest."
Why is the object slowest at maximum displacement in SHM?,Because force is strongest there,Because it’s about to reverse direction,Because velocity is maximum there,Because acceleration is zero,B,"At ±A, the object momentarily stops to reverse direction, so its velocity is zero at that instant."
