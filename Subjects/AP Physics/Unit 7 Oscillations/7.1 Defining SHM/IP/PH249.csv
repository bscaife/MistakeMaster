Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student claims that an object in SHM stops moving when it reaches the equilibrium position. What is the correct understanding?,The object reverses direction at equilibrium,The object stops and stays at equilibrium,The object speeds up after equilibrium,The object continues through equilibrium with maximum speed,D,"In SHM, the object reaches maximum velocity at the equilibrium point and passes through it. The motion only reverses at the extremes, not equilibrium."
"In SHM, what is true about the object's velocity as it passes through equilibrium?",It is zero,It is at maximum value,It is undefined,It changes direction,B,"The velocity is greatest at the equilibrium position in SHM, where all potential energy is converted to kinetic energy."
What happens to an oscillating mass on a spring as it moves through the equilibrium position?,It reverses direction,It has zero acceleration,It momentarily stops,It has maximum speed,D,The speed is highest at equilibrium where the restoring force is zero and energy is fully kinetic: v₍max₎ at x = 0.
Which of the following best describes the motion of an object in SHM?,"It speeds up until it reaches equilibrium, then stops",It slows down and stops at equilibrium,It passes through equilibrium with maximum speed and reverses at the ends,It stops at the ends and equilibrium,C,"SHM involves continuous motion through equilibrium where speed is maximum. Reversals occur at turning points, not at x = 0."
At what point in SHM is the object’s kinetic energy greatest?,At the maximum displacement,Halfway to equilibrium,At the equilibrium position,When velocity is zero,C,"At equilibrium (x = 0), the object’s velocity is maximum, and thus kinetic energy is maximum while potential energy is zero."
"In SHM, why does the object not stop at equilibrium?",There is no force acting at equilibrium,Momentum carries it through equilibrium,Gravity pulls it back,Friction speeds it up,B,"Although net force is zero at equilibrium, the object has nonzero velocity (and momentum), so it continues moving through."
How does the object’s motion behave right after it passes through equilibrium in SHM?,It begins to decelerate,It comes to a stop,It reverses direction,It remains at constant velocity,A,"After passing through equilibrium, the restoring force begins to act in the opposite direction, decelerating the object toward the next turning point."
Why is the acceleration zero at the equilibrium point in SHM?,Because it’s the end of the motion,Because displacement is zero and F = -k·x,Because gravity is zero,Because velocity is zero,B,"At equilibrium, x = 0, so F = -k·x = 0. Thus, acceleration a = F/m = 0. But velocity is at maximum, so motion continues."
Which graph correctly shows velocity in SHM as the object passes through equilibrium?,Velocity spikes to a maximum,Velocity drops to zero,Velocity reverses direction,Velocity slowly increases,A,Velocity is greatest at equilibrium in SHM because potential energy is minimum and kinetic energy is maximum.
What is the object's motion immediately after reaching the equilibrium point in SHM?,It oscillates back to the same side,It stops and holds position,It continues moving due to inertia,It accelerates toward the center,C,"The object has maximum velocity at equilibrium and continues moving through due to inertia, as there is no net force to stop it at that point."
