Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student increases the amplitude of a mass oscillating on a spring. What happens to the period of the motion?,It increases,It decreases,It remains the same,It first increases then decreases,C,"For ideal SHM, period is given by T = 2·π·√(m/k), which is independent of amplitude. So increasing amplitude does not change the period."
Which change will affect the period of a simple pendulum undergoing small-angle oscillations?,Doubling the mass,Increasing the amplitude,Increasing the length,Changing the color of the bob,C,"The period of a pendulum is T = 2·π·√(L/g), which depends on length and gravity, but not on amplitude for small angles."
"If the amplitude of oscillation is doubled in a mass-spring system, what is the effect on the period?",The period is halved,The period doubles,The period remains constant,The period increases slightly,C,"In SHM, T = 2·π·√(m/k) does not include amplitude. Thus, period is unaffected by changing amplitude in ideal conditions."
Which of the following statements is true for small-angle pendulum motion?,Larger amplitude means shorter period,Amplitude affects frequency but not period,Amplitude has no effect on period,Mass affects period but not amplitude,C,"For a small-angle pendulum, T = 2·π·√(L/g). Neither mass nor amplitude appears in the equation, so period is unaffected by amplitude."
A spring-mass system is set to oscillate with a larger amplitude. Which variable changes?,Period,Mass,Maximum speed,Spring constant,C,"Larger amplitude increases the maximum speed and total energy, but period remains the same since T = 2·π·√(m/k)."
What happens to the time for one cycle of SHM if the amplitude is reduced by half?,Time doubles,Time is halved,Time stays the same,Time increases slightly,C,"The period of SHM is independent of amplitude: T = 2·π·√(m/k) or T = 2·π·√(L/g), depending on the system."
A pendulum and a mass-spring system both oscillate with different amplitudes. What can be said about their periods?,Larger amplitude means longer period in both cases,Amplitude affects the pendulum but not the spring,Amplitude has no effect on either system's period,Period is shorter for higher amplitude in both cases,C,"In both ideal systems (small-angle pendulum and mass-spring), T is independent of amplitude, as shown in T = 2·π·√(m/k) and T = 2·π·√(L/g)."
For which of these motions is amplitude irrelevant to the period?,Mass on spring with no friction,Pendulum at small angles,Both A and B,Neither A nor B,C,"Both systems are governed by SHM equations where period depends on mass, spring constant, or length and gravity—but not amplitude."
Which graph correctly shows the relationship between amplitude and period in ideal SHM?,A horizontal line,An upward curve,A straight diagonal line,A downward curve,A,"Since period is constant with respect to amplitude, the graph is a horizontal line. T = 2·π·√(m/k) or T = 2·π·√(L/g) contains no amplitude term."
Why does increasing the amplitude of a mass-spring oscillator not affect its period?,Friction cancels the change,The system compensates by reducing mass,The period formula has no amplitude term,Because energy is constant,C,"T = 2·π·√(m/k) shows no dependence on amplitude. SHM’s defining equation relies on mass and spring constant, not how far the mass is stretched."
