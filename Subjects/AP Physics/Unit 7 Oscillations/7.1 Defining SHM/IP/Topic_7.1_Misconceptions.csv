Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH246,Simple harmonic motion must involve springs,"Assumes SHM only occurs with mass-spring systems, overlooking other cases like pendulums or oscillating carts."
PH247,Amplitude affects period in all SHM,"Fails to realize that for ideal SHM (like mass-spring or small-angle pendulum), period is independent of amplitude."
PH248,SHM requires a net constant force,"Misunderstands that SHM involves a restoring force proportional to displacement, not a constant net force."
PH249,The object stops at equilibrium in SHM,"Thinks the motion ends when the object reaches equilibrium, not recognizing SHM continues through it."
PH250,SHM acceleration is constant,"Confuses SHM with uniform acceleration, not realizing that acceleration in SHM varies with position."
PH251,Velocity and acceleration peak at the same time,"Fails to understand that in SHM, velocity is zero when acceleration is maximum, and vice versa."
PH252,Only mass affects motion in SHM,Ignores that both spring constant or pendulum length (depending on system) influence the period of oscillation.
