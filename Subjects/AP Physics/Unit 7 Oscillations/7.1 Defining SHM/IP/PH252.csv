Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student claims only the mass affects motion in SHM. What else determines the period in a mass-spring system?,Amplitude,Spring constant,Displacement,Velocity,B,"The period for a mass-spring system is T = 2·π·√(m/k), so both mass and spring constant affect the motion—not just mass."
Which variable affects the period of a pendulum in SHM?,Mass,Length,Amplitude,Frequency,B,"The period of a simple pendulum is T = 2·π·√(L/g), so it depends on length and gravity, not mass."
What happens to the period of a spring-mass oscillator if the spring becomes stiffer (higher k)?,It increases,It decreases,It remains constant,It becomes infinite,B,"T = 2·π·√(m/k), so increasing k decreases the period. A stiffer spring leads to faster oscillations."
"In a pendulum system, what happens to the period if mass is doubled?",It doubles,It is halved,It remains the same,It increases by √2,C,"The pendulum’s period is T = 2·π·√(L/g), which does not include mass. So changing mass has no effect."
Why does increasing the spring constant k change the period of oscillation?,Because energy is conserved,Because force increases with k,Because period depends on √(m/k),Because velocity becomes constant,C,"The spring-mass period formula is T = 2·π·√(m/k). As k increases, the square root gets smaller, reducing period."
A student increases the mass in a spring-mass system. What is the expected outcome?,The period increases,The period decreases,The period stays the same,The amplitude increases,A,T = 2·π·√(m/k). Increasing mass increases the period since it slows the system’s response to the restoring force.
Which of the following does NOT affect the period of a spring-mass system in ideal SHM?,Mass,Spring constant,Amplitude,None of the above,C,"In ideal SHM, T = 2·π·√(m/k), independent of amplitude. Larger amplitude changes energy, not period."
A student says heavier pendulums swing slower. How should you respond?,Correct – heavier means slower motion,Incorrect – mass doesn’t affect pendulum period,Correct – mass increases inertia and changes period,"Incorrect – mass only affects velocity, not period",B,T = 2·π·√(L/g) shows no mass term. The period of a pendulum is mass-independent under ideal conditions.
How can the period of a pendulum be increased?,By increasing mass,By decreasing mass,By increasing length,By decreasing amplitude,C,"The pendulum period T = 2·π·√(L/g) increases with longer length, since the square root increases."
Which formula shows that motion in SHM depends on more than just mass?,T = 2·π·√(k/m),T = 2·π·√(m/k),F = m·a,U = m·g·h,B,T = 2·π·√(m/k) clearly shows that both mass and spring constant influence period—not mass alone.
