Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student claims that only spring systems can undergo simple harmonic motion (SHM). Which of the following contradicts this misconception?,A pendulum swinging at small angles,A crate sliding on a frictionless surface,A satellite orbiting the Earth,A car moving at constant velocity,A,"SHM occurs when the restoring force is proportional to displacement: F = -k·x. A pendulum at small angles experiences a restoring torque that results in SHM, even though it involves gravity, not a spring."
Which system exhibits simple harmonic motion despite not using a spring?,A block hanging from a string and rotating in a horizontal circle,A pendulum swinging with small amplitude,An object launched upward under gravity,A puck gliding on an air hockey table,B,A pendulum at small angles obeys SHM because its restoring force is proportional to displacement: F = -k·x analogously with angular motion.
A teacher says SHM can happen in any system with a linear restoring force. Which of the following is an example?,A mass oscillating in a spring,A frictionless cart oscillating between two magnets with equal repelling forces,A car bouncing on its suspension,All of the above,D,"All listed systems involve restoring forces proportional to displacement, so all exhibit SHM: F = -k·x."
A swinging pendulum and a vibrating tuning fork are both examples of what type of motion?,Circular motion,Uniform motion,Simple harmonic motion,Random motion,C,"Both systems experience restoring forces proportional to displacement. SHM is defined by F = -k·x, satisfied by pendulums (at small angles) and tuning forks."
Which condition must be met for a system to exhibit SHM?,The object must move vertically,The force must always point in the same direction,The restoring force must be proportional to displacement,The system must contain a spring,C,SHM requires a restoring force that obeys F = -k·x. This does not depend on the presence of a spring or direction of motion.
Why can a mass oscillating on a frictionless curved track shaped like a parabola exhibit SHM?,Because the mass is in free fall,Because gravity cancels out all forces,Because the restoring force is linear near the bottom,Because there’s no energy loss,C,"Near the lowest point of a parabolic track, the restoring force is approximately linear in displacement: F = -k·x, producing SHM."
Which motion best illustrates SHM without involving a spring?,A frictionless puck rebounding between two walls,A pendulum with small angular displacement,An object in uniform circular motion,A rock in projectile motion,B,"A pendulum at small angles produces a restoring torque proportional to displacement from equilibrium: F = -k·x, satisfying SHM conditions."
An object undergoing SHM must always...,Be attached to a spring,Move back and forth through equilibrium,Experience constant force,Be rotating,B,"In SHM, the object oscillates through equilibrium due to a restoring force proportional to displacement: F = -k·x."
Which of these does NOT exhibit SHM under typical conditions?,A pendulum swinging at small angles,A vibrating guitar string,A car coasting at constant speed,A mass on a spring,C,SHM involves oscillation about an equilibrium point due to F = -k·x. A car at constant speed doesn’t oscillate or experience a restoring force.
What property makes both pendulums and springs suitable for SHM analysis?,Their masses are equal,They oscillate in circles,They both produce restoring forces proportional to displacement,They don’t lose energy,C,"SHM occurs when the force is F = -k·x. Both ideal springs and small-angle pendulums meet this condition, allowing SHM analysis."
