Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student claims that velocity and acceleration are both maximum at the same point in SHM. What is the correct relationship?,They are both maximum at equilibrium,They both reach maximum at turning points,"Velocity is maximum when acceleration is zero, and vice versa",They both peak halfway to maximum displacement,C,"In SHM, velocity is maximum at equilibrium where acceleration is zero. Acceleration is maximum at turning points where velocity is zero."
When is acceleration maximum in simple harmonic motion?,At equilibrium,At halfway points,At maximum displacement,At the point of maximum speed,C,"Acceleration is given by a = -k·x/m, so it’s greatest when displacement x is greatest — at the ends of the motion."
When does an object in SHM have zero acceleration?,At maximum displacement,At the midpoint,When velocity is zero,Throughout the motion,B,"At equilibrium (x = 0), F = -k·x = 0, so acceleration is zero. Velocity is maximum there."
What is true about velocity and acceleration at maximum displacement in SHM?,"Velocity is maximum, acceleration is zero","Velocity is zero, acceleration is maximum",Both are zero,Both are maximum,B,"At maximum displacement (±A), velocity is zero because it’s a turning point, and acceleration is at maximum due to max restoring force."
At which point in SHM is velocity maximum and acceleration zero?,At the turning points,At the midpoint (equilibrium),At the maximum height,It never happens,B,"At equilibrium, displacement is zero, so acceleration is zero. Velocity is highest here as all energy is kinetic."
"In a position vs. time graph of SHM, when is the slope greatest?",At maximum displacement,When crossing equilibrium,At the beginning only,Slope is always constant,B,"Slope of a position-time graph gives velocity, which peaks at equilibrium. So the slope is steepest at that point."
A student draws a velocity vs. time graph that peaks at the same time as acceleration. What’s the issue?,They forgot the restoring force,They confused SHM with circular motion,They didn’t account for phase difference in SHM,It’s correct for vertical oscillation,C,"In SHM, velocity and acceleration are 90° out of phase. Acceleration peaks when velocity is zero and vice versa."
Which of the following is true in ideal SHM?,Maximum acceleration and velocity occur together,Acceleration lags behind velocity,Velocity and acceleration are always in opposite directions,Velocity is zero when acceleration is maximum,D,Velocity is zero at turning points where acceleration is maximum due to large restoring force: F = -k·x.
How are kinetic and potential energy related to velocity and acceleration in SHM?,Both are maximum together,"Kinetic energy peaks with velocity, potential energy with acceleration",They’re unrelated,They both peak at equilibrium,B,"Kinetic energy is tied to velocity (K = ½·m·v²), peaking at equilibrium. Potential energy (U = ½·k·x²) and acceleration peak at maximum displacement."
"In SHM, when is the net force acting on the object equal to zero?",When the object is at maximum displacement,When velocity is zero,When the object passes through equilibrium,Always,C,"F = -k·x, so force is zero when x = 0, which is at equilibrium. At this point, velocity is max, acceleration is zero."
