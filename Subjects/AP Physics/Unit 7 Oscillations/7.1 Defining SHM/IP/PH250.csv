Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says the acceleration in SHM is constant. What is the correct statement?,Acceleration stays constant during SHM,Acceleration varies depending on mass,Acceleration is greatest at equilibrium,Acceleration is proportional to displacement from equilibrium,D,"In SHM, acceleration follows a = -k·x/m, meaning it changes depending on the object's position relative to equilibrium."
Which best describes the acceleration of an object in SHM?,It is zero throughout the motion,It is constant in magnitude,It varies with position,It is always negative,C,"Acceleration in SHM is given by a = -k·x/m, so it varies with the displacement from equilibrium, not constant."
What is the value of acceleration in SHM at the equilibrium position?,Maximum,Zero,Equal to gravity,Undefined,B,"At x = 0, the restoring force is zero (F = -k·x), so acceleration is also zero since a = F/m."
Where in SHM is the magnitude of acceleration the greatest?,At the equilibrium position,Halfway between equilibrium and max displacement,At maximum displacement,It is always the same,C,"Acceleration is largest at the maximum displacement (x = ±A), where F = -k·A and a = -k·A/m is at its peak value."
Which graph represents acceleration vs. position in SHM?,A horizontal line,A parabola opening upward,A sine wave,A straight line with negative slope,D,"Since a = -k·x/m, acceleration is linearly related to position with a negative slope. It forms a straight line."
What happens to acceleration in SHM as the object moves away from equilibrium?,It decreases,It stays constant,It increases proportionally with displacement,It becomes zero,C,Acceleration in SHM grows linearly with distance from equilibrium: a = -k·x/m.
A student says acceleration is constant because force is constant in SHM. What’s the correct explanation?,Force is constant but acceleration is not,Both force and acceleration are variable in SHM,Acceleration depends only on time,Acceleration is constant during one half of the motion,B,"Since F = -k·x and a = F/m, both force and acceleration change with position in SHM."
What physical law links acceleration and displacement in SHM?,Newton’s second law: a = -k·x/m,Hooke’s law: F = m·a²,Conservation of momentum,Ohm’s law,A,"Using F = -k·x and Newton’s law F = m·a, we derive a = -k·x/m, showing that acceleration is position-dependent."
"If an SHM system has a displacement of 0.05 m, what happens to acceleration if displacement doubles?",It doubles,It stays the same,It becomes zero,It halves,A,"Because a = -k·x/m, if x doubles, acceleration also doubles in magnitude, maintaining the proportional relationship."
Which of the following correctly compares SHM to uniform acceleration?,SHM and uniform acceleration both involve constant force,SHM has position-dependent acceleration; uniform acceleration does not,SHM and uniform acceleration produce parabolic motion,"In both, acceleration is constant and always in one direction",B,"SHM involves a restoring force proportional to position, so acceleration varies with x. In contrast, uniform acceleration is constant in size and direction."
