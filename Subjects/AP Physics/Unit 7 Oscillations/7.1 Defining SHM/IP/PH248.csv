Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student claims SHM involves a constant net force. Which of the following best corrects that misconception?,The net force increases as the object speeds up,The net force always equals zero,The net force is constant in direction but not in size,The net force is proportional to displacement from equilibrium,D,"In SHM, the net force is described by F = -k·x, meaning it changes with position and is always directed toward equilibrium—not constant in magnitude."
Which force condition defines simple harmonic motion?,Constant net force,Zero net force,Force proportional to displacement,Random force fluctuations,C,"SHM requires F = -k·x. This force law means the force changes linearly with displacement, not constant as in uniform acceleration."
A block attached to a spring oscillates on a frictionless surface. What is true about the net force acting on the block?,It is constant and negative,It always points away from equilibrium,It is constant and positive,It changes depending on position,D,"The spring exerts a restoring force proportional to displacement: F = -k·x, so net force depends on the block’s position."
"If the net force in a system remains constant, what kind of motion results?",Simple harmonic motion,Uniform circular motion,Constant acceleration,Oscillatory motion,C,"A constant net force causes constant acceleration (F = ma), not SHM. SHM requires a variable force: F = -k·x."
Which equation correctly represents the condition for SHM?,F = m·a = -k·x,F = constant,F = 0,F = m·v,A,"SHM is governed by F = -k·x, where force is proportional and opposite to displacement, not constant or zero."
What does a graph of net force vs. displacement look like for SHM?,A straight horizontal line,A vertical line,A straight line with negative slope,A sine wave,C,"In SHM, F = -k·x gives a linear relationship between force and displacement, producing a straight line with negative slope."
Which scenario best illustrates a system experiencing SHM?,A ball falling at constant acceleration,A block on a spring oscillating back and forth,A car moving at constant velocity,A satellite in circular orbit,B,"Only the spring system experiences a restoring force proportional to displacement: F = -k·x, meeting the condition for SHM."
"If an object undergoes SHM, what happens to the direction of the net force throughout the motion?",It remains constant,It always points toward equilibrium,It switches randomly,It points away from equilibrium,B,"The restoring force in SHM always points toward the equilibrium position, even though its magnitude varies: F = -k·x."
How does Newton’s second law apply in SHM?,The acceleration is constant due to a constant force,Acceleration is proportional to the velocity,Acceleration is proportional to the displacement,There is no net force,C,"Using F = m·a and F = -k·x, we find a = -(k/m)·x. So acceleration varies with displacement, not constant as in uniform motion."
A student says SHM requires a constant force like gravity. What is the best correction?,Gravity is not involved in SHM,"SHM uses constant energy, not constant force",SHM requires a force that increases with speed,SHM involves a restoring force that changes with displacement,D,"In SHM, the force is not constant like gravity near Earth’s surface, but instead F = -k·x — dependent on position."
