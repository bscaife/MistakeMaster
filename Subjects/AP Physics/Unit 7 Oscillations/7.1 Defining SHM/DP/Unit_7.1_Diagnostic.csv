Question,Correct Answer,Choice A,Correct? A,Code A,Choice B,Correct? B,Code B,Choice C,Correct? C,Code C,Choice D,Correct? D,Code D,Explanation
A pendulum of length 2.0 m is released from a small angle. Which factor will determine its period of oscillation?,D,The constant net force acting on the pendulum,FALSE,PH248,The maximum displacement from equilibrium,FALSE,PH249,The amplitude of the swing,FALSE,PH247,The length of the pendulum,TRUE,,"The period of a small-angle pendulum is given by T = 2π√(L/g), which depends only on the length L and gravity g, not amplitude or force magnitude."
A 0.50 kg mass on a spring oscillates with a period of 1.2 s. What will happen to the period if the amplitude is doubled?,C,It will increase slightly due to greater displacement,FALSE,PH247,It will halve,FALSE,PH247,It will remain the same,TRUE,,It will double,FALSE,PH247,"For ideal SHM, T = 2π√(m/k), so period is independent of amplitude."
"In ideal simple harmonic motion, when is the acceleration of the mass greatest?",D,Acceleration is constant throughout,FALSE,PH250,At the equilibrium position,FALSE,PH250,Halfway between equilibrium and maximum displacement,FALSE,PH250,At maximum displacement from equilibrium,TRUE,,"In SHM, a = -(k/m)x, so acceleration magnitude is greatest at maximum |x| and zero at equilibrium."
A mass-spring system oscillates in SHM. What type of force provides the restoring effect?,B,A constant net force,FALSE,PH248,A force proportional to displacement from equilibrium,TRUE,,A force that only acts at the endpoints,FALSE,PH249,A force unrelated to displacement,FALSE,PH248,"SHM requires a restoring force proportional to displacement (F = -kx), not a constant or position-independent force."
"When an object in SHM passes through the equilibrium position, what will happen to its motion?",C,Its acceleration will be maximum,FALSE,PH250,It will reverse direction immediately,FALSE,PH249,It will continue moving due to inertia,TRUE,,It will stop moving,FALSE,PH249,"At equilibrium in SHM, velocity is maximum and acceleration is zero, so the object passes through and continues moving."
Which change will increase the period of a simple pendulum undergoing small oscillations?,D,Stopping it at equilibrium,FALSE,PH249,Increasing the amplitude of oscillation,FALSE,PH247,Applying a constant net downward force,FALSE,PH248,Increasing the length of the pendulum,TRUE,,"T = 2π√(L/g), so increasing L increases the period; amplitude and constant net force do not affect T for small angles."
At what point in SHM is the velocity of the object zero?,B,At equilibrium,FALSE,PH249,At maximum displacement from equilibrium,TRUE,,Velocity is never zero in SHM,FALSE,PH249,Velocity is constant in SHM,FALSE,PH250,"Velocity is zero at maximum displacement where direction reverses; at equilibrium, velocity is maximum."
"For a mass-spring system, how is the restoring force related to displacement?",D,It increases with speed,FALSE,PH248,It acts only when the mass is stationary,FALSE,PH249,It is constant regardless of displacement,FALSE,PH248,Directly proportional,TRUE,,"F = -kx, showing the restoring force is proportional to displacement and opposite in direction."
"If a pendulum is oscillating in ideal SHM, what is true about acceleration at equilibrium?",D,Acceleration depends only on mass,FALSE,PH250,Acceleration is maximum,FALSE,PH250,Acceleration is constant,FALSE,PH250,Acceleration is zero,TRUE,,"In SHM, a = -(k/m)x, so at x = 0, acceleration is zero."
Why does an object in SHM continue moving past the equilibrium point?,B,It stops due to no net force,FALSE,PH249,It has maximum kinetic energy at equilibrium,TRUE,,It has maximum acceleration at equilibrium,FALSE,PH250,It is pushed by a constant net force,FALSE,PH248,"Kinetic energy is maximum and acceleration zero at equilibrium, so the object moves through due to inertia."
