Code,Error,Explanation
MA1,Sign Error,"Misinterpreting positive and negative directions in vector quantities like velocity, acceleration, or displacement."
MA2,Equation Misapplication,Plugging numbers into an equation without verifying if it matches the physical situation.
MA3,Missing or Incorrect Units,"Failing to include units in calculations, or incorrectly converting units (e.g., cm to m)."
MA4,Graph Interpretation Error,"Misreading slope, area, or shape on motion graphs; confusing constant slope with constant velocity or acceleration."
MA5,Dropping Variables,Accidentally omitting terms during algebraic rearrangement or simplification.
MA6,Incorrect Isolation,Failing to correctly isolate the desired variable when solving equations.
MA7,Exponent Mistakes,"Forgetting to square, square root, or incorrectly applying exponents while manipulating equations."
MA8,Factoring/Expanding Errors,"Incorrectly factoring or expanding algebraic expressions, leading to wrong final forms."
MA9,Combining Like Terms Incorrectly,"Improperly adding or subtracting terms, especially confusing variables with coefficients."
MA10,Oversimplification of Relationships,Assuming all relationships are linear; failing to recognize inverse square or quadratic relationships.
MA11,Failure to Check Limiting Cases,"Not verifying if an equation or answer makes sense when applying extreme or boundary conditions (e.g., t â†’ 0)."
