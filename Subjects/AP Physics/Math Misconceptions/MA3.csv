Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A car moves 300 cm in 2 seconds. What is its speed in meters per second (m/s)?,v = 0.015 m/s,v = 150 m/s,v = 15 m/s,v = 1.5 m/s,D,"First convert 300 cm to meters: 300 cm ÷ 100 = 3 m. Then, speed = distance/time = 3 m ÷ 2 s = 1.5 m/s."
A mass of 2500 g is placed on a spring. What mass value should be used in calculations in SI units?,m = 25 kg,m = 2.5 kg,m = 0.25 kg,m = 250 kg,B,Grams must be converted to kilograms: 2500 g ÷ 1000 = 2.5 kg for correct SI unit usage.
A force is calculated as F = 10 kg × 2 m/s². What is the correct unit for force?,kg,m/s²,kg·m,N (newtons),D,"Force in SI units is expressed in newtons (N), where 1 N = 1 kg·m/s²."
An object travels 5 km. How many meters is this distance?,0.5 m,5000 m,500 m,50 m,B,"To convert kilometers to meters, multiply by 1000: 5 km × 1000 = 5000 m."
You calculate a speed as v = 4.2 but do not write any unit. What is missing?,m,m²/s,m/s,s,C,Velocity must be expressed with units of meters per second (m/s); omitting units is incorrect.
A measurement reads 1500 ms. What is this in seconds (s)?,150 s,1.5 s,15 s,0.15 s,B,Milliseconds must be converted to seconds: 1500 ms ÷ 1000 = 1.5 s.
A student finds the kinetic energy as 250 but forgets the unit. What unit should be written?,W (watts),N (newtons),kg,J (joules),D,Kinetic energy is measured in joules (J); forgetting to include the unit makes the answer incomplete.
Which unit correctly expresses work done in the SI system?,N (newtons),kg·m,J (joules),W (watts),C,"Work is measured in joules (J), not newtons or watts; watts measure power, not work."
A mass is given as 0.003 kg. What is this mass in grams (g)?,0.03 g,30 g,3 g,300 g,C,"To convert kilograms to grams, multiply by 1000: 0.003 kg × 1000 = 3 g."
Which of the following is the correct unit for pressure in the SI system?,Pa (pascals),W (watts),N (newtons),J (joules),A,"Pressure is measured in pascals (Pa), which equals N/m²."
