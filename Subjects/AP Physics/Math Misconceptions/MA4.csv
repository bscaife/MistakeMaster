Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"On a position vs. time graph, a straight line with a positive constant slope represents what type of motion?",Increasing acceleration,Constant positive velocity,Constant positive acceleration,Constant position,B,"On a position vs. time graph, the slope represents velocity. A straight line with positive constant slope means constant positive velocity."
"On a velocity vs. time graph, the slope of the line represents what quantity?",Velocity,Position,Displacement,Acceleration,D,"The slope of a velocity vs. time graph gives acceleration, not velocity or displacement."
What does the area under a velocity vs. time graph represent?,Velocity,Position,Displacement,Acceleration,C,"The area under a velocity vs. time graph gives displacement, while slope gives acceleration."
A flat horizontal line on a velocity vs. time graph means what?,Changing velocity,Constant acceleration,Constant velocity,Zero displacement,C,A flat line on a velocity vs. time graph indicates constant velocity because the value of velocity does not change with time.
"On a position vs. time graph, what does a curve getting steeper over time represent?",Constant acceleration,Increasing velocity,Decreasing displacement,Constant velocity,B,A steeper slope over time on a position vs. time graph means the object's velocity is increasing.
"On a velocity vs. time graph, a line with negative constant slope represents what?",Constant speed,Decreasing displacement,Constant negative acceleration,Constant negative velocity,C,A negative slope on a velocity vs. time graph means constant negative acceleration (deceleration).
"On an acceleration vs. time graph, a flat horizontal line above the time axis means what?",Constant positive velocity,Constant positive acceleration,Increasing acceleration,Zero acceleration,B,"A flat, positive line on an acceleration vs. time graph represents constant positive acceleration."
"On a position vs. time graph, a flat horizontal line represents what type of motion?",Constant positive acceleration,Constant positive velocity,Constant negative velocity,Zero velocity (object at rest),D,"A flat line on a position vs. time graph shows no change in position, meaning zero velocity (at rest)."
What does the area under an acceleration vs. time graph represent?,Change in acceleration,Change in velocity,Change in displacement,Change in position,B,The area under an acceleration vs. time graph gives the change in velocity.
"If the slope of a velocity vs. time graph is zero, what can we conclude?",Constant displacement,Constant velocity,Increasing velocity,Zero acceleration,B,Zero slope on a velocity vs. time graph means no change in velocity â€” constant velocity.
