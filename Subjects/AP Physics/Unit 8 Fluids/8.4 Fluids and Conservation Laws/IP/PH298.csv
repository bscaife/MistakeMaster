Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Bernoulli’s equation assumes:,Fluid is compressible,Energy is added to the fluid,"No friction, steady flow, incompressible fluid",Friction increases speed,C,"Bernoulli’s equation assumes no friction, steady flow, and incompressible fluid."
When is Bernoulli’s equation valid?,Any fluid flow,Fluids with major friction losses,"Steady, incompressible flow without significant friction",All real-world cases,C,"It applies when fluid flow is steady, incompressible, and friction is negligible."
Bernoulli’s equation cannot be applied when:,Pressure is the same everywhere,Energy is gained by the fluid,Friction or significant energy loss occurs,Velocity stays the same even with friction,C,"If significant friction or energy loss occurs, Bernoulli’s equation is invalid."
"If energy is lost to friction, Bernoulli’s equation:",Still gives correct results,Only slightly changes the result,No longer accurately describes the situation,Still describes speed perfectly,C,Energy loss means Bernoulli’s predictions are no longer accurate.
Bernoulli’s principle applies best to:,Turbulent flows,Flows with strong viscous forces,"Steady, ideal fluid flows",Flows with rapid energy loss,C,"Bernoulli’s equation applies best to smooth, steady, low-friction fluid flow."
Why must energy conservation be considered before applying Bernoulli’s equation?,Friction and turbulence always enhance accuracy,Friction does not change energy balance,Bernoulli’s equation assumes no external energy losses,Turbulence automatically cancels friction effects,C,Energy conservation is critical because Bernoulli’s principle is based on constant total energy.
Can Bernoulli’s equation be used for turbulent flow with large energy loss?,"Yes, it always works","Yes, with minor adjustments","No, because turbulence causes energy loss","Maybe, depending on fluid density",C,"Turbulent flows involve energy loss, invalidating Bernoulli’s assumptions."
Bernoulli’s equation is invalid if:,The fluid is moving very fast,The fluid is being pumped,Frictional forces dominate motion,More friction improves Bernoulli's accuracy,C,Bernoulli’s equation is invalid if frictional losses dominate motion.
"When using Bernoulli’s equation between two points, you assume:",Significant energy is lost to heat,Work is being done on the fluid,Mechanical energy is conserved,Energy is created within the fluid,C,Using Bernoulli’s equation assumes mechanical energy is conserved.
In which case can Bernoulli’s equation be used accurately?,Water pouring chaotically from a faucet,"Air moving through a leaky, rough pipe","Smooth, steady flow along a streamline",Chaotic or highly viscous flow,C,"Bernoulli’s equation is accurate for smooth, steady flows along a streamline."
