Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH295,Fluid flow requires energy input,"Assumes a pump or force is needed at all times for fluid to flow, ignoring that pressure and height differences can drive motion."
PH296,Flow rate increases with narrower pipe,Confuses speed with flow rate; does not understand that flow rate stays constant (continuity equation) while velocity increases.
PH297,Pressure increases in narrower regions,"Misinterprets Bernoulli's principle, believing higher speed corresponds to higher pressure instead of lower pressure."
PH298,Bernoulli’s equation applies everywhere,"Applies Bernoulli’s equation blindly, including across elevations or locations with friction or energy loss, where it’s not valid."
PH299,Torricelli’s theorem needs mass or force,"Thinks calculating exit speed of fluid requires knowledge of mass or force, instead of just height difference."
PH300,Pressure and speed increase together,"Fails to understand that fluid speed increases where pressure drops, not rises, when applying Bernoulli."
PH301,Conservation laws do not apply to fluids,"Thinks mass and energy conservation break down in flowing fluids, ignoring ideal flow assumptions."
