Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What causes fluid to flow through a pipe without an external pump?,A motor pushing it,Pressure difference or gravity,Electricity flowing through water,Only active pumping,B,Pressure difference or gravity can drive fluid flow without motors or pumps.
Water flows downhill in a river mainly because of:,Wind pushing it downhill,Gravity/pressure,Pressure from above,Manual stirring,B,Gravity causes rivers to flow downhill by creating a pressure gradient.
Which of the following is necessary for fluid flow?,An engine at the end of the pipe,Pressure differences,Friction between molecules,Human intervention,B,Pressure differences or elevation differences are needed for fluid flow.
"In a siphon, fluid moves from a higher container to a lower one due to:",Gravity and pressure differences,Magnetic force,External air pressure alone,Electromagnetic forces,A,A siphon works due to gravity and pressure differences between heights.
Why does water flow out of a hole near the bottom of a tank?,Gravity pulling the water downward,Pumps force it out,Surface tension pulling water,Chemical reactions,B,Water exits holes in tanks because of pressure created by water height.
"In a natural spring, water emerges from the ground because:",The water is heated from below,Pressure from below pushes water upward,Magnetism attracts water molecules upward,Geothermal heat pushes water,B,Underground pressure forces water out at springs without pumps.
Which statement is true about fluid flow without pumps?,Fluids cannot flow without external energy,Fluids can flow due to pressure and elevation differences,Fluids need air currents to move,Movement always requires engines,B,Fluids can flow naturally when pressure or height differences exist.
"If the height of a tank increases, what happens to the water flow speed out of a hole?",Flow speed decreases,Flow speed stays the same,Flow speed increases,Flow stops completely,C,Higher water height means greater pressure and faster flow speed.
How can fluids move without continuous external work being done?,Constant external force pushes it,A pressure difference,Heat causes expansion,Sunlight pushes it,B,Fluids can move without external forces if there is a natural pressure gradient.
"In a sealed container, fluid flow starts when:",A heater raises fluid temperature,Wind enters the container,The internal pressure increases,Nothing can cause it without a machine,C,Increased internal pressure causes fluids to start flowing.
