Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"According to Torricelli’s theorem, the speed of fluid exiting a hole depends on:",Fluid's mass,Fluid's density,Height of fluid above the hole,Temperature of the fluid,C,"Torricelli’s theorem says fluid exit speed depends only on height difference, not mass."
Torricelli’s law for fluid speed is based on:,The object's weight,External forces pushing fluid,Gravitational potential energy converting to kinetic energy,Mass of the container,C,The law is based on gravitational potential energy converting into kinetic energy.
"If water exits a tank through a hole, what determines the speed?",The mass of the water,The total volume of water,Height of water above the hole,Force applied to the water,C,"The water’s height above the hole determines its exit speed, not mass or force."
What formula gives the exit speed v of fluid from height h?,v = √(2·h),v = √(g/h),v = √(2·g·h),v = 2·g·h,C,"Exit speed is v = √(2·g·h), involving gravitational acceleration and height."
Which factor is NOT needed to calculate the exit speed using Torricelli’s theorem?,Fluid mass,External force on the tank,Height of fluid,Downward force from gravity,C,Mass or force is not needed; only the height matters in Torricelli’s theorem.
"If the height of water doubles, what happens to the exit speed?",Exit speed doubles,Exit speed cuts in half,Exit speed increases by √2,Exit speed stays the same,C,"Exit speed increases by a factor of √2 when height doubles, not doubles linearly."
"In Torricelli’s equation, mass of fluid:",Directly affects the speed,Has no effect on the speed,Is irrelevant in calculating speed,Reduces the exit speed,C,Mass does not affect the exit speed according to Torricelli’s formula.
"If two tanks have holes at the same height but different amounts of water, what is true about their exit speeds?",The tank with more water has greater speed,The tank with less water has greater speed,Both have the same exit speed,Depends on mass only,C,"Exit speed depends only on hole height, so both tanks have the same exit speed."
Torricelli’s theorem is derived from:,Conservation of volume,Conservation of frictional force,Conservation of energy,Newton’s second law,C,Torricelli’s theorem comes from conservation of energy between gravitational and kinetic forms.
"If a tank is very wide and the exit hole is small, what assumption is made in applying Torricelli’s theorem?",Water surface speed is high,Energy is added by a pump,Speed of surface motion must be considered,No assumptions are needed,C,"In applying Torricelli’s theorem, it’s assumed that surface speed is negligible compared to exit speed."
