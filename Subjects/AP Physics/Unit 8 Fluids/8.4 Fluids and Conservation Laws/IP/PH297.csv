Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"According to Bernoulli’s principle, when fluid speed increases, what happens to pressure?",Pressure increases,Pressure stays the same,Pressure decreases,No relation between speed and pressure,C,"Bernoulli’s principle states that as fluid speed increases, pressure decreases."
"In a narrowing section of a pipe, fluid pressure:",Pressure increases,Pressure stays the same,Pressure decreases,Pressure fluctuates randomly,C,"In a narrowing section, faster flow causes lower pressure."
"When water flows faster through a constricted pipe, the pressure there is:",Higher,Unchanged,Lower,Depends on temperature,C,Faster water flow through a narrow pipe results in lower pressure.
"In regions where fluid moves slower, what happens to the pressure?",Pressure decreases,Pressure stays the same,Pressure increases,Pressure fluctuates,C,Slower-moving fluid has higher pressure.
Bernoulli’s principle shows that in a fluid:,Pressure and speed increase together,Pressure remains constant,"As speed increases, pressure decreases",Pressure disappears completely,C,"As speed increases, fluid pressure decreases, following Bernoulli’s equation."
Why does an airplane wing generate lift?,Higher pressure above the wing,Higher speed below the wing,Lower pressure above the wing,No change in pressure,C,"Lift is generated because air moves faster over the wing, creating lower pressure above."
"If air moves faster over the top of a wing, the pressure above the wing is:",Greater than below the wing,Equal to below the wing,Lower than below the wing,Pressure depends only on mass,C,Faster airflow above a wing creates lower pressure compared to below.
"As river water speeds up through a narrow gorge, what happens to the water pressure?",Increases,Remains constant,Decreases,Random pressure changes,C,"In a narrow gorge where water speeds up, pressure decreases."
A pipe widens suddenly. What happens to the pressure inside the pipe?,Pressure decreases,Pressure stays the same,Pressure increases,Flow stops,C,"When a pipe widens and speed drops, pressure increases."
"In fluid flow, higher velocity means:",Higher pressure,Same pressure,Lower pressure,No effect on pressure,C,Higher velocity corresponds to lower pressure in fluid dynamics.
