Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"When the speed of a fluid increases, what happens to its pressure according to Bernoulli’s principle?",Pressure increases,Pressure stays the same,Pressure decreases,Pressure fluctuates randomly,C,"Bernoulli’s principle states that where fluid speed increases, pressure decreases."
"In a narrow pipe where fluid moves faster, the pressure is:",Higher than in the wide pipe,Stays the same,Lower than in the wide pipe,Random depending on turbulence,C,Fluid pressure is lower in narrow sections where speed is higher.
"As air moves faster over the top of a wing, the air pressure above the wing:",Increases,Stays the same,Decreases,Fluctuates randomly,C,"Air pressure above the wing decreases because air moves faster, creating lift."
"In regions where fluid slows down, the pressure:",Decreases,Remains constant,Increases,Random changes occur,C,"In slower regions, fluid pressure increases as speed drops."
Bernoulli’s equation shows that pressure and speed are:,Directly proportional,Unrelated,Inversely related,Always equal,C,Speed and pressure are inversely related in a flowing fluid according to Bernoulli.
Why does a fast-moving fluid have lower pressure?,More pressure is created by fast movement,More force is pushing forward,Energy conservation demands trade-off between pressure and speed,Faster fluids create static force,C,"Higher speed uses up more kinetic energy, leaving less available pressure energy."
"If pressure increases along a streamline, the fluid speed:",Also increases,Remains unchanged,Decreases,Fluctuates,C,"As pressure increases, fluid speed decreases based on energy conservation."
An airplane flies because:,The air below moves faster than air above,Weight of the plane pulls it up,Air moves faster over the top causing lower pressure above,Turbulence lifts the plane,C,"Faster air over the wing causes lower pressure above, generating lift."
"If a river flows faster through a narrow section, the pressure there is:",Higher than in wide sections,Unaffected by speed,Lower than in wide sections,Becomes chaotic,C,"In narrow, faster-flowing sections of rivers, pressure is lower than in wider regions."
Which statement best summarizes Bernoulli’s principle?,Faster fluid means higher pressure,Slower fluids exert more force,Higher speed corresponds to lower pressure,Higher speed corresponds to higher force,C,"Higher fluid speed corresponds to lower pressure, following Bernoulli’s equation."
