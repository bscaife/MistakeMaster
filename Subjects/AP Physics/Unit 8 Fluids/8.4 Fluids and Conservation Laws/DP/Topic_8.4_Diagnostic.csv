"According to the continuity equation, what happens to the speed of an incompressible fluid as it enters a narrower section of pipe?",A,It speeds up because the same volume must pass through a smaller area.,True,,It slows down because there's less space to move.,False,PH296,Speed stays the same regardless of pipe shape.,False,PH298,The fluid stops unless energy is added.,False,PH295,"From A₁·v₁ = A₂·v₂, decreasing area (A₂ < A₁) means velocity (v₂) must increase for incompressible flow."
"A fluid speeds up as it moves through a narrow pipe. What happens to the pressure in that region, according to Bernoulli’s principle?",B,The pressure increases with the higher speed.,False,PH300,The pressure decreases because kinetic energy increases.,True,,Pressure stays constant through the flow.,False,PH298,This only works if external forces are added.,False,PH295,"Bernoulli’s equation (P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant) shows that higher speed corresponds to lower pressure in steady, incompressible, frictionless flow."
What does Bernoulli’s equation assume about the fluid and flow conditions?,C,The fluid is at rest and in thermal equilibrium.,False,PH298,There must be an external energy source like a pump.,False,PH295,The fluid is incompressible and flows steadily without friction.,True,,It applies regardless of whether the flow is turbulent.,False,PH298,"Bernoulli’s equation is valid only under specific assumptions: steady, incompressible, non-viscous (frictionless) flow along a streamline."
Water exits a tank from a small hole near the bottom. What does Torricelli’s theorem say about the speed of water exiting?,D,It depends on the mass of water above the hole.,False,PH299,It requires force from above to push the water out.,False,PH295,It increases as the hole gets smaller.,False,PH296,It equals the speed of a free-falling object from that height.,True,,"Torricelli’s law: v = √(2gh), where h is the fluid height above the hole. No mass or force is needed — gravity does the work."
Which of the following statements best reflects conservation of mass in fluid flow?,A,Incompressible fluid flow means what goes in must come out at the same rate.,True,,Fluid always moves from high to low pressure.,False,PH297,Energy is lost when fluid changes shape.,False,PH298,Fluids require input force to conserve volume.,False,PH295,Continuity equation is based on conservation of mass: A₁v₁ = A₂v₂. Flow rate stays constant for incompressible fluids.
"In a horizontal pipe, the fluid speeds up in a narrow section. Which conservation law explains why pressure drops in that region?",B,Conservation of mass: less area means less pressure.,False,PH296,Conservation of energy: increase in speed means decrease in pressure.,True,,Conservation of volume: pipe volume is constant.,False,PH301,External force is required to maintain speed.,False,PH295,"Bernoulli’s principle is an application of energy conservation. As speed increases, pressure must drop to conserve total mechanical energy."
What happens to the flow rate if a pipe splits into two branches of equal diameter and both carry fluid?,C,The flow rate increases due to added pathways.,False,PH296,The pressure must increase to split the flow.,False,PH297,The total flow rate remains the same as in the main pipe.,True,,Flow stops unless a pump is added.,False,PH295,"According to continuity, total flow rate remains conserved. It divides between branches, but total rate stays constant."
Why is Bernoulli’s equation not valid in regions of turbulence or viscosity?,D,It requires energy input to maintain turbulence.,False,PH295,It assumes mass and force must be equal.,False,PH299,"It only works for gases, not liquids.",False,PH298,It assumes no energy is lost to internal friction.,True,,"Bernoulli’s equation assumes ideal (non-viscous, steady) flow. Turbulent or viscous regions violate these assumptions by introducing energy loss."
"A fluid exits vertically downward from a tank’s bottom. If the tank's height doubles, how does the exit speed change?",A,It increases by a factor of √2 based on Torricelli’s theorem.,True,,It doubles because height and speed are directly proportional.,False,PH299,It remains constant without external energy.,False,PH295,Only force can increase the speed.,False,PH295,"Using Torricelli’s law, v = √(2gh). If h doubles, v becomes √(2g·2h) = √2·√(2gh), so speed increases by √2."
"In an ideal fluid system, why does pressure decrease when speed increases?",B,The fluid becomes less dense at high speed.,False,PH298,"Energy is conserved: kinetic energy rises, so pressure energy falls.",True,,"Mass increases in motion, requiring pressure loss.",False,PH301,The pipe narrows to prevent backflow.,False,PH296,Bernoulli’s equation shows that total mechanical energy is conserved. More kinetic energy (higher speed) means less pressure energy.
