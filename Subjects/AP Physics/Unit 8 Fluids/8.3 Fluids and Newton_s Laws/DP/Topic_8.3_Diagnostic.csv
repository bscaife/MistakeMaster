A solid metal ball is completely submerged in water but does not float. Which statement is true about the buoyant force acting on it?,A,A buoyant force acts upward even though the object sinks.,True,,No buoyant force acts because the object is too heavy.,False,PH288,The object only feels downward force from gravity.,False,PH290,The buoyant force equals the object's weight.,False,PH289,"Buoyant force acts on all submerged objects, regardless of whether they float. It depends on the displaced fluid, not whether the object rises."
Two objects of the same size but different materials are fully submerged in a fluid. Which has a greater buoyant force acting on it?,B,The heavier object has more buoyant force because it weighs more.,False,PH291,Both experience the same buoyant force because they displace the same volume.,True,,Only the floating object feels a buoyant force.,False,PH288,The object with greater density experiences more upward push.,False,PH290,"Buoyant force depends on volume displaced and fluid density, not object mass. Same volume means equal buoyant force."
Which statement correctly describes the origin of buoyant force in a fluid?,C,It is caused by gravity pulling upward on the fluid.,False,PH292,It happens only when the object floats.,False,PH288,It results from the pressure difference between the top and bottom of an object.,True,,It is due to water being lighter than the object.,False,PH293,"Buoyant force arises from greater pressure at the bottom than at the top of an object, creating a net upward force."
A cube floats in water with half of its volume submerged. What is the relationship between the buoyant force and the cube’s weight?,D,"The cube is weightless, so no buoyant force is needed.",False,PH288,The buoyant force is greater than the weight.,False,PH289,Only the bottom of the cube experiences any upward force.,False,PH290,The buoyant force equals the cube’s weight.,True,,"For a floating object in equilibrium, buoyant force equals the object's weight. That’s why it floats stably at that level."
Which object would experience the greatest buoyant force?,A,A fully submerged beach ball in water.,True,,A heavy rock resting on the ground.,False,PH291,A sponge half-submerged in air.,False,PH293,A steel bar placed in a vacuum chamber.,False,PH290,"Buoyant force depends on fluid displacement. The beach ball displaces a large volume of water and is fully submerged, creating a strong buoyant force."
An object is placed in oil and water. It floats between the two fluids. What does this tell us about the buoyant forces acting on it?,B,Only the water contributes to the buoyant force.,False,PH293,It is supported by the combined buoyant force from both fluids.,True,,Buoyant force is absent because the object is not fully submerged.,False,PH288,"The object has no weight, so buoyant force is irrelevant.",False,PH289,The object displaces fluid in both layers. The total buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced oil plus the displaced water.
Two objects of different shapes but identical volumes and materials are fully submerged in a liquid. Which experiences greater buoyant force?,C,The flatter object experiences more buoyant force.,False,PH294,The taller object pushes upward harder due to height.,False,PH291,"Both experience the same force because buoyancy depends on volume and fluid, not shape.",True,,The object with a curved surface experiences more upward force.,False,PH294,Buoyant force depends only on fluid density and displaced volume. Shape does not affect total fluid displaced if volume is the same.
A helium balloon rises in air but slows down at higher altitudes. Why does the buoyant force change?,D,"Gravity weakens at higher altitudes, reducing buoyancy.",False,PH292,The balloon becomes heavier as it expands.,False,PH289,Buoyant force only works near the ground.,False,PH288,"Air density decreases with altitude, so less fluid is displaced.",True,,"Buoyant force = ρ·V·g. As altitude increases, air density (ρ) decreases. Less dense air means reduced buoyant force, slowing the balloon."
Which factor determines the strength of the buoyant force on a submerged object?,A,The volume of fluid displaced by the object.,True,,The mass of the object only.,False,PH289,The weight of the object minus its volume.,False,PH289,Whether the object is solid or hollow.,False,PH294,"According to Archimedes' principle, buoyant force equals the weight of displaced fluid, which depends on volume, not object mass."
A block sinks in alcohol but floats in water. What can be said about the block’s density?,B,"It floats in water due to its shape, not density.",False,PH294,Its density is between that of alcohol and water.,True,,It has no buoyant force in alcohol.,False,PH288,All blocks float better in water regardless of density.,False,PH293,"The block’s density is greater than alcohol (so it sinks) and less than water (so it floats), placing it between the two."
