Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH288,Buoyant force only exists when objects float,"Thinks buoyant force is present only if an object floats, ignoring that it acts on all submerged or partially submerged objects."
PH289,Buoyant force equals object weight,"Assumes buoyant force always matches the object's weight, not realizing it depends on the displaced fluid's weight."
PH290,Fluids don't exert upward force,"Believes fluids only exert downward pressure, neglecting the net upward force due to pressure differences with depth."
PH291,Heavier objects displace more fluid regardless of volume,"Confuses mass with volume in Archimedes’ principle, ignoring that fluid displacement depends on submerged volume."
PH292,Buoyant force is due to gravity pulling up,"Misunderstands that buoyant force is a result of pressure difference, not upward gravitational attraction."
PH293,Buoyancy applies only in water,"Thinks buoyant force doesn’t apply in other fluids like air, ignoring that the same principles apply to all fluids."
PH294,Buoyant force depends on object's shape,Believes that shape determines buoyant force rather than volume of displaced fluid.
