Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
An object sinks in water. What can we say about the buoyant force compared to its weight?,Buoyant force equals weight,Buoyant force is greater than weight,Buoyant force is less than weight,There is no buoyant force,C,"If an object sinks, its weight is greater than the buoyant force."
An object floats with 30% of its volume above water. How does the buoyant force compare to its weight?,Buoyant force equals weight,Buoyant force is greater than weight,Buoyant force is less than weight,There is no buoyant force,B,"Floating means the buoyant force matches the weight, even if part of the object is above water."
A helium balloon rises in air. How does the buoyant force compare to the balloon’s weight?,Buoyant force equals weight,Buoyant force is less than weight,Buoyant force is greater than weight,No buoyant force acts on the balloon,A,A rising balloon shows buoyant force exceeds the balloon’s weight.
"An object is fully submerged in oil and remains at rest, neither rising nor sinking. What must be true?",Buoyant force is greater than weight,Buoyant force equals weight,No buoyant force acts,Buoyant force is less than weight,B,At rest while submerged means buoyant force equals the object’s weight.
Two objects have equal weight but different volumes. Which experiences the greater buoyant force when submerged?,The smaller object has greater buoyant force,The larger object has greater buoyant force,Both experience equal buoyant force,None of the above,B,"Larger volume displaces more fluid, creating a greater buoyant force."
"If a metal cube is denser than water and fully submerged, how does its buoyant force compare to its weight?",Buoyant force is greater than weight,Buoyant force equals weight,Buoyant force is less than weight,No buoyant force acts,C,"For sinking objects, weight exceeds the buoyant force."
A cork floats on water with most of it above the surface. What does this indicate about the cork’s density relative to water?,Cork is denser than water,Cork is less dense than water,Cork and water have equal densities,Cork has zero density,B,Floating with most volume above water shows the cork is much less dense than water.
An ice cube floats with about 90% of its volume submerged. What does this tell us about the buoyant force on the ice cube?,Buoyant force is less than weight,Buoyant force equals weight,Buoyant force is greater than weight,No buoyant force acts,B,Floating objects experience buoyant force equal to their weight.
"If the density of a fluid increases but the object remains the same, how does the buoyant force change?",Buoyant force decreases,Buoyant force increases,Buoyant force stays the same,Buoyant force becomes zero,B,Increasing fluid density increases the buoyant force because ρ·V·g increases.
An iron nail is dropped into water and sinks. Which statement is true about the buoyant force on the nail?,No buoyant force acts on it,Buoyant force is greater than weight,Buoyant force equals weight,Buoyant force is less than weight,D,The sinking nail still experiences a buoyant force smaller than its weight.
