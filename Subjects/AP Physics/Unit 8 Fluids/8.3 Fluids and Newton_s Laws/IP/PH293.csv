Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which of the following objects experiences a buoyant force?,Only objects in water,Only objects in air,Any object in any fluid,Only objects in solids,C,Any object submerged in any fluid (liquid or gas) experiences a buoyant force.
A hot air balloon rises because:,"Air has no effect, only gravity",Air pressure is greater at higher altitudes,Buoyant force from air is greater than the balloon’s weight,The balloon generates its own lift,C,The balloon floats because buoyant force from air exceeds its weight.
An object submerged in oil feels a buoyant force because:,Oil pulls up on the object,Buoyant force acts downward,Oil exerts pressure differences causing buoyancy,No buoyant force acts in oil,C,"Pressure differences in oil create an upward buoyant force, just like in water."
Buoyant force exists in which of the following fluids?,Only water exerts buoyant forces,Only thick fluids exert buoyant forces,All fluids exert buoyant forces,Only gases exert buoyant forces,C,All fluids — including liquids and gases — exert buoyant forces.
"If a blimp floats in air, the buoyant force must equal:",Its weight,The fluid's weight,The displaced fluid's weight,Zero,C,The buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid.
What causes a helium balloon to float upward in air?,Helium molecules push it upward,Temperature differences push it upward,Air pressure is greater below the balloon than above,Gravity pulls harder upward,C,Greater air pressure below the balloon causes the net upward buoyant force.
A swimmer floats in the ocean due to:,Water molecules lifting the swimmer,The swimmer’s lungs exert force,Buoyant force due to pressure difference in water,Saltwater removes weight,C,A pressure difference in water creates the buoyant force making the swimmer float.
"If an object floats in oil but sinks in water, what changes?",The object's mass increases,Oil is heavier than water,Oil is less dense than water,Water and oil act the same,C,"Oil’s density relative to the object determines whether it floats or sinks, not just water."
Buoyancy occurs in a fluid when:,The object is heavier than the fluid,The fluid's temperature increases,Pressure is greater below than above the object,Fluids must be heavier than the object,C,Buoyant force occurs when pressure below is greater than pressure above in any fluid.
Which of these statements about buoyant force is correct?,Buoyancy only happens in liquids,Buoyant force depends on mass alone,Buoyant force occurs due to pressure differences in any fluid,Buoyant force happens only in oceans,C,"Buoyant force is caused by pressure differences in all fluids, not just water."
