Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What factor determines the buoyant force on a submerged object?,The object's shape,The object's mass,The volume of fluid displaced,The surface area of the object,C,"Buoyant force depends only on the volume of fluid displaced, not the shape or mass."
Two objects have different shapes but the same volume. Which experiences more buoyant force?,The more streamlined object,The longer object,Same for both,The wider object,C,"Buoyant force depends only on volume and fluid density — both objects displace the same volume, so they experience the same buoyant force."
"If two objects displace equal volumes of fluid, which has greater buoyant force?",The heavier object,The larger mass,Both experience the same buoyant force,The denser object,C,"Equal displaced volumes mean equal buoyant forces, independent of object mass."
A cube and a sphere of the same volume are submerged. Which feels a greater buoyant force?,The cube,The sphere,Both experience the same buoyant force,The object with the bigger surface area,C,Shape does not matter — same volume displaced gives the same buoyant force.
"If an object’s shape changes but its volume remains constant, what happens to buoyant force?",Buoyant force changes,Buoyant force remains the same,Buoyant force stays the same,Buoyant force disappears,C,Changing shape without changing volume does not affect buoyant force.
An irregular-shaped rock and a perfect sphere of the same volume are submerged. Buoyant force depends on:,The rock’s surface texture,The rock’s irregularity,The volume each displaces,The object’s density,C,"Buoyant force depends on the volume of displaced fluid, not surface features."
A hollow sphere and a solid cube have the same volume submerged. Which statement is true?,The hollow sphere experiences more,The cube experiences more,Both experience the same buoyant force,Neither experiences buoyant force,C,"Equal submerged volume leads to equal buoyant force, regardless of object type."
When does an object experience greater buoyant force?,When the object is flat,When the object is smooth,When the displaced volume increases,When it has a complicated shape,C,Greater displaced fluid volume leads to greater buoyant force.
A ship floats because:,Its shape traps air,It’s made of lighter material,It displaces enough fluid to balance its weight,Its color affects pressure,C,A ship floats because it displaces a volume of water whose weight balances its own weight.
Which of the following affects the buoyant force the most?,The object's weight,The object's color,The displaced fluid’s volume,The object's temperature,C,The volume of displaced fluid is the main factor determining buoyant force.
