Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What causes the buoyant force on a submerged object?,Gravity pulling upward,Magnetic force,Difference in fluid pressure at different depths,Wind currents underwater,C,Buoyant force is caused by higher fluid pressure at greater depths compared to shallower depths.
Which force is responsible for creating buoyant force?,The object's weight pulling upward,Friction between water and the object,Difference in pressure between bottom and top,Friction with the fluid,C,The difference in pressure between bottom and top surfaces generates the buoyant force.
A block is submerged and feels an upward force. What is the direct cause of this?,Gravity pulling upward,Magnetic repulsion,Higher fluid pressure at bottom than top,The Earth's magnetic field,C,Higher fluid pressure on the bottom surface causes an upward force.
Why does a floating object experience an upward force?,Gravity lifting the object,Water is lighter than the object,Greater fluid pressure underneath,Earthâ€™s rotation pushing objects up,C,Floating results from greater fluid pressure below than above the object.
Buoyant force results from:,Gravitational attraction upward,Water trying to remove objects,Difference in fluid pressure with depth,Water molecules pulled upward,C,"Buoyant force arises from pressure differences, not gravitational pulling upward."
Which description correctly explains buoyancy?,Gravity acting upward,Water molecules pushing upward,Greater pressure beneath than above,Gravity decreasing underwater,C,Greater pressure underneath an object creates a net upward force.
The reason an object rises in water is because:,Gravity pulls it upward,Water repels objects upward,Higher pressure at lower depths,Magnetic fields acting upward,C,Higher pressure at lower depths pushes objects upward in fluids.
Why is pressure higher at the bottom of an object in water?,Water pulls upward,Air pushes downward,Depth causes higher fluid pressure,Temperature differences in the water,C,"Pressure increases with depth, leading to greater upward force at the bottom."
"If gravity disappeared, what would happen to fluid pressure?",Pressure would stay the same,Pressure would increase,Pressure would vanish,Pressure would reverse direction,C,"Without gravity, there would be no weight to create pressure, and thus no buoyant force."
Buoyant force depends on:,The object's mass,The object's density,The volume of fluid displaced,The temperature of the fluid,C,"Buoyant force depends on the volume of fluid displaced, related to pressure differences."
