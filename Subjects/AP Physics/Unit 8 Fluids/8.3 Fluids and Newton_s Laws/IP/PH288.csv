Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A metal block is fully submerged underwater but does not float. What can be said about the buoyant force acting on it?,There is no buoyant force because it sinks,The buoyant force is greater than the block’s weight,The buoyant force is equal to the block’s weight,"There is a buoyant force, but it is less than the block’s weight",D,"Buoyant force always acts on submerged objects, but sinking means the weight exceeds the buoyant force."
"If a wooden ball floats with half of its volume submerged, what does this tell us about the buoyant force?",It is greater than the ball’s weight,It equals the ball’s weight,It is less than the ball’s weight,It depends on the water’s temperature,B,"For floating objects, the buoyant force exactly equals the object's weight."
A submarine adjusts its buoyancy by taking in water. What happens to the buoyant force?,It decreases because weight increases,It increases because volume increases,It decreases because volume decreases,It stays the same regardless of volume,A,"Increasing mass without changing volume causes the weight to increase while the buoyant force remains based on volume, making it seem reduced."
An object experiences a buoyant force of 50 N and weighs 70 N. What is the net force acting on it?,20 N upward,20 N downward,120 N downward,120 N upward,B,Net force = weight – buoyant force = 70 N – 50 N = 20 N downward.
A beach ball is pushed completely underwater and then released. What causes it to accelerate upward?,Gravity,Air trapped inside,Water pressure below it is greater than above,No forces act on it,C,"The difference in water pressure beneath and above the ball creates an upward buoyant force, causing acceleration."
A rock thrown into a pond sinks to the bottom. Which statement is true?,No buoyant force acts on the rock,Buoyant force equals rock’s weight,Buoyant force is less than rock’s weight,Buoyant force is greater than rock’s weight,C,"A sinking object still experiences buoyant force, but it is smaller than its weight."
"A block floats with ⅔ of its volume submerged. If the fluid’s density increases, what happens to the submerged volume fraction?",Increases,Decreases,Stays the same,Block sinks,B,Higher fluid density allows the same buoyant force with less submerged volume.
"A sealed empty container floats on water. If holes are poked in the container and water fills it, what happens to the buoyant force?",Increases,Decreases,Stays constant,Vanishes completely,B,"As the container fills, it displaces less volume of water and the buoyant force decreases."
"If two identical-looking cubes are submerged, and one floats while the other sinks, what must differ between them?",Volume,Shape,Density,Surface area,C,"Objects with the same volume but different densities behave differently: denser sinks, less dense floats."
"A solid sphere is suspended by a string in a fluid and stays at rest, fully submerged. What is the tension in the string?",Greater than the buoyant force,Less than the buoyant force,Equal to the weight minus the buoyant force,Equal to the buoyant force plus the weight,C,Tension must balance the difference between the weight and the buoyant force: T = W – Fᵦ.
