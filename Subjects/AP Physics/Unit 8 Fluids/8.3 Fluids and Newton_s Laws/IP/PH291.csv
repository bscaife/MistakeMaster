Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation,Choice E
"According to Archimedes’ principle, the buoyant force on an object depends on:",Its mass,Its density,The volume of fluid displaced,The object’s weight alone,C,"Buoyant force depends on the volume of fluid displaced, not the object's mass.",
Two objects with different masses but identical volumes are submerged. Which statement is true?,The heavier object displaces more fluid,Both displace equal fluid,The lighter object displaces more fluid,Neither displaces fluid,B,"Objects with equal volume displace equal amounts of fluid, regardless of mass.",
A small heavy rock and a large light plastic block are submerged. Which displaces more water?,The rock displaces more water,The plastic block displaces more water,Both displace equal fluid,Neither displaces water,B,Larger volume causes greater displacement even if the material is lighter.,
An iron ball and a wooden ball of the same volume are submerged. Which experiences greater buoyant force?,The iron ball,Both experience the same buoyant force,The wooden ball,Neither,B,Same volume submerged means same displaced fluid and same buoyant force.,
"If a metal block sinks faster than a same-sized plastic block, what does this say about fluid displacement?",The metal displaces more fluid,The plastic displaces more fluid,They displace the same amount,No displacement occurs,C,"Fluid displacement depends on volume, not mass or sinking speed.",
A heavier object displaces more fluid if:,It sinks,It has greater volume,It has greater density,It is heavier,B,Greater volume leads to greater fluid displacement according to Archimedes’ principle.,
A floating object's displaced fluid weight is equal to:,The object's mass,The object's density,The object's volume,The object's weight,D,"For a floating object, the buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid, which equals the object’s weight.",
"If a submerged object’s volume increases, the buoyant force:",Decreases,Increases,Stays the same,Drops to zero,B,Larger submerged volume increases buoyant force because more fluid is displaced.,
"If an object becomes denser without changing volume, what happens to displaced fluid?",Displaces less fluid,Displaces the same amount of fluid,No fluid is displaced,Displaces more fluid,B,Changing density alone doesn't affect fluid displacement unless volume changes.,
"When comparing two submerged objects, the one displacing more fluid must have:",Greater mass,Greater density,Greater volume,Greater weight,C,Greater submerged volume results in greater fluid displacement.,
