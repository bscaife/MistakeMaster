Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What causes the upward buoyant force on a submerged object?,Gravity pulling on the fluid,The object's own pressure,Higher pressure at greater depths,No forces act under water,C,Greater fluid pressure at the bottom compared to the top causes an upward buoyant force.
Why is there greater pressure at the bottom of a submerged object than at the top?,Water molecules at the top push harder,Depth increases pressure in fluids,Temperature difference in the fluid,No forces act under water,B,"Fluid pressure increases with depth, causing greater pressure at the bottom."
A swimmer feels lighter underwater because:,Water removes some of the swimmer's weight,Upward pressure from water is greater than downward force,The swimmer becomes weightless,Swimmers generate upward lift themselves,C,The upward buoyant force due to pressure difference makes the swimmer feel lighter.
A ball held completely underwater feels an upward push. What causes this force?,The object is less dense than water,Gravity pulling down on the object,Higher fluid pressure at greater depth pushes upward,No forces act underwater,C,The higher fluid pressure at the bottom pushes upward on the ball.
"If fluid pressure only acted downward, what would happen to submerged objects?",They would not feel any force,They would be pushed upward only,They would be pushed downward and stay down,Objects would float with no cause,C,"If pressure only acted downward, submerged objects would stay down with no upward force."
How does the pressure difference create buoyant force?,Pressure is equal all over the object,Pressure at the top is greater than at the bottom,"Bottom pressure > Top pressure, creating a net upward force",There is no difference in pressure at all,C,Higher pressure at greater depth results in a net upward buoyant force.
A stone submerged in a pond experiences:,Only downward force,Upward force only,Equal upward and downward forces,More force down than up,D,A submerged stone has more weight than buoyant force.
Which of the following statements about fluid pressure is true?,Pressure pushes only downward,Pressure pushes outward in all directions,"Pressure pushes in all directions, including upward",Pressure only decreases with height,C,"Fluid pressure pushes equally in all directions, including upward and sideways."
"If a cup is filled with water, where is the greatest pressure?",At the water surface,At the middle of the cup,At the bottom of the cup,No pressure anywhere,C,Pressure is greatest at the bottom because pressure increases with depth.
A beach ball underwater accelerates upward because:,Gravity stops acting underwater,There is no pressure at all,"Water pressure is greater at deeper points, creating upward force",Water stops exerting forces underwater,C,Upward acceleration comes from higher pressure under the ball than above it.
