"Two cubes of the same size are made of different materials. Cube A has a mass of 2 kg, and Cube B has a mass of 4 kg. Which statement best compares their densities?",A,Cube B has twice the density of Cube A.,True,,Both cubes have the same density because they are the same size.,False,PH274,Cube A is less dense because it has less weight.,False,PH274,Density cannot be compared unless they are placed in water.,False,PH280,"Density is defined as mass divided by volume. Since both cubes have the same volume, the one with greater mass (Cube B) has greater density. So: density = mass ÷ volume → B is twice as dense."
A student says that a balloon rises because it is 'lighter' than air. Which explanation more accurately reflects the concept of buoyancy?,B,The balloon floats because it has less mass than the surrounding air.,False,PH274,"The balloon is less dense than the air it displaces, causing an upward net force.",True,,The balloon rises because gravity does not act on gases.,False,PH278,"The balloon has more volume than the air, so it is pushed upward.",False,PH277,"Buoyant force depends on density, not just mass. A balloon rises because its density is lower than that of air, creating upward buoyant force as described by Archimedes' principle."
A rock sinks in water while a wooden block of the same size floats. What can you conclude about their densities?,C,The wood floats because it is hollow inside.,False,PH280,"The rock is heavier, so it sinks regardless of volume.",False,PH274,"The rock is denser than water, while the wood is less dense than water.",True,,Both objects have the same density because they are the same size.,False,PH275,Sinking or floating depends on density relative to water. Equal volume does not mean equal density. The rock has greater density than water; the wood has less.
Which statement correctly describes the difference between mass and volume?,D,An object’s weight determines its volume.,False,PH274,Mass and volume are interchangeable depending on the object.,False,PH277,More mass always means more volume.,False,PH275,Mass is the amount of matter; volume is the space it occupies.,True,,"Mass is a measure of matter; volume is spatial extent. They are related via density, but not interchangeable. Two objects can have the same mass and different volumes or vice versa."
A sealed empty plastic bottle is weighed and then crushed. Its mass stays the same. What best explains this?,A,"The volume changed but the mass stayed constant, so density increased.",True,,The bottle lost weight when crushed because it got smaller.,False,PH274,"Solids cannot change volume, so this must be a measurement error.",False,PH279,"Mass depends on size, so the new mass must be lower.",False,PH275,"Crushing changes volume but not mass. Since density = mass ÷ volume, reducing volume while keeping mass constant increases density. Solids can’t compress easily, but plastic can."
A metal cube and a plastic cube have equal masses but different volumes. What can be concluded about their densities?,A,The metal cube is denser because it has less volume for the same mass.,True,,Both cubes have equal density because their mass is the same.,False,PH274,Both cubes have equal density because their mass is the same.,False,PH274,Density cannot be compared without knowing their weights.,False,PH274,"Density = mass ÷ volume.

Which of the following best explains why steel sinks in water but some ships made of steel can float?,D,Steel floats when shaped like a bowl because it's lighter than water.,False,PH276,Steel floats when shaped like a bowl because it's lighter than water.,False,PH276,Steel becomes less dense when heated during construction.,False,PH280,Ships are large enough to displace more water than their weight.,True,,"Floating depends on average density. A ship's shape displaces enough water to generate upward buoyant force greater than its weight, even if the material itself sinks."
A student argues that weight and density are the same because heavier objects always feel denser. What is a better explanation?,A,"Density is a ratio of mass to volume, independent of gravitational force.",True,,Density is weight divided by height.,False,PH277,Density is weight divided by height.,False,PH277,Heavier objects feel denser due to their thickness.,False,PH275,"Weight depends on gravity, but density is mass ÷ volume. Two objects with the same weight can have different densities if their volumes differ."
Two identical containers are filled with water to different heights. Container A has a depth of 1 m and B has 2 m. Which statement best describes the pressure at the bottom?,A,Container B has twice the pressure at the bottom as Container A.,True,,Both containers have the same pressure because they are identical in shape.,False,PH281,"Pressure depends only on the amount of water, not its height.",False,PH283,"Water pressure depends on container width, not depth.",False,PH281,"Fluid pressure increases with depth: P = ρ·g·h. Since depth doubles from A to B, pressure at the bottom of B is twice that at A."
A diver feels more pressure on their body as they descend deeper underwater. What causes this increase in pressure?,B,Pressure increases only from above as the diver goes deeper.,False,PH282,Pressure increases because water pushes equally from all directions at greater depth.,True,,"The diver gets heavier with depth, increasing pressure.",False,PH283,Only large animals can feel pressure at depth.,False,PH287,Pressure in fluids acts in all directions and increases with depth due to the weight of the fluid above. It’s not just downward.
Which situation shows that air pressure exists even when air isn’t moving?,C,A breeze makes leaves rustle.,False,PH284,An open window allows wind to blow in.,False,PH284,A suction cup sticks to a wall without airflow.,True,,A fan pushes air toward someone’s face.,False,PH284,"Air pressure exists even in still air. A suction cup stays because external air pressure pushes it against the wall, even though the air is not moving."
Why can a sealed empty can be crushed when the air inside is removed?,D,The can is crushed only from the top by gravity.,False,PH286,Air rushes in and increases internal pressure.,False,PH284,The mass of the can causes it to collapse.,False,PH283,The unbalanced external air pressure pushes from all sides.,True,,"When internal pressure is removed, the greater external air pressure crushes the can from all sides, not just from the top."

The deeper part of the dam experiences more pressure, so it must be built thicker to withstand the force."
Which of the following best explains why your ears pop during a rapid change in altitude?,D,"You are moving faster, which increases air pressure.",False,PH284,Pressure is stronger inside your body than outside.,False,PH282,Only moving air creates pressure changes in your ears.,False,PH284,"Air pressure changes, and your body adjusts to match the surrounding pressure.",True,,"Air pressure exists even when air is still. A change in altitude alters the external pressure, and your body adjusts to maintain equilibrium, causing ears to pop."
A hydraulic press uses a small piston to lift a heavy object. What explains how this works?,A,"Pressure is transmitted equally through the fluid, multiplying the force on a larger piston.",True,,Larger pistons always create more pressure.,False,PH287,"Fluids flow downward, so the force increases naturally.",False,PH282,"Only gases can transmit pressure evenly, not liquids.",False,PH285,"Pascal’s principle states that pressure applied to a fluid is transmitted equally in all directions, allowing force multiplication on a larger piston."
Why might a person feel less buoyant at deeper depths?,B,The body becomes heavier at greater depth.,False,PH287,"The buoyant force remains the same, but pressure increases equally on all sides.",True,,"More water is pressing down from above, reducing upward force.",False,PH286,Only the top of the body experiences extra pressure.,False,PH286,Buoyant force doesn’t decrease with depth; pressure increases equally in all directions. The sensation of compression may be misinterpreted as less buoyancy.
"What is true about pressure in a closed fluid system, such as a sealed syringe?",C,Only the part nearest the piston feels increased pressure.,False,PH282,Gases in the syringe create uneven pressure distribution.,False,PH284,Applying pressure to one part increases pressure everywhere equally.,True,,Pressure acts only downward inside the syringe.,False,PH282,"According to Pascal’s principle, pressure applied to a confined fluid is distributed equally throughout the fluid."

It depends on the displaced fluid, not whether the object rises."
Two objects of the same size but different materials are fully submerged in a fluid. Which has a greater buoyant force acting on it?,B,The heavier object has more buoyant force because it weighs more.,False,PH291,Both experience the same buoyant force because they displace the same volume.,True,,Only the floating object feels a buoyant force.,False,PH288,The object with greater density experiences more upward push.,False,PH290,"Buoyant force depends on volume displaced and fluid density, not object mass.
