Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH274,Density is the same as weight,"Confuses density (mass per unit volume) with weight, which depends on gravitational force."
PH275,Density depends on amount,"Thinks that more of a substance increases its density, rather than recognizing density as an intensive property."
PH276,Objects float if they are lighter,"Believes that absolute weight determines floating, ignoring that density relative to fluid is the key factor."
PH277,Mass and volume are interchangeable,Fails to distinguish between how much matter is in an object and how much space it occupies.
PH278,Air has no density,Assumes gases are 'weightless' or 'massless' despite having measurable density.
PH279,Solids can be compressed like fluids,Ignores that solids have fixed structure and negligible compressibility compared to fluids.
PH280,Ideal fluids have the same behavior as real fluids,"Does not understand that ideal fluids ignore viscosity and compressibility, unlike real-world substances."
PH281,Pressure is the same at all depths,Fails to recognize that pressure increases with depth due to the weight of the fluid above.
PH282,Pressure acts only downward,Does not understand that fluid pressure acts equally in all directions at a point in a fluid.
PH283,Only force affects pressure,Ignores the role of surface area in calculating pressure; doesn't apply the formula P = F/A correctly.
PH284,Air pressure is only present when air is moving,"Thinks that still air doesn't exert pressure, rather than understanding atmospheric pressure exists regardless of motion."
PH285,Liquids exert more pressure than gases due to weight alone,"Overgeneralizes liquid density and weight, without considering compressibility and depth-related variation in gases."
PH286,Objects are crushed by fluid pressure only from above,"Fails to see that fluid pressure surrounds objects and acts in all directions, not just from the top."
PH287,Larger objects exert more pressure,"Confuses force with pressure, neglecting the inverse relationship between pressure and area."
PH288,Buoyant force only exists when objects float,"Thinks buoyant force is present only if an object floats, ignoring that it acts on all submerged or partially submerged objects."
PH289,Buoyant force equals object weight,"Assumes buoyant force always matches the object's weight, not realizing it depends on the displaced fluid's weight."
PH290,Fluids don't exert upward force,"Believes fluids only exert downward pressure, neglecting the net upward force due to pressure differences with depth."
PH291,Heavier objects displace more fluid regardless of volume,"Confuses mass with volume in Archimedes’ principle, ignoring that fluid displacement depends on submerged volume."
PH292,Buoyant force is due to gravity pulling up,"Misunderstands that buoyant force is a result of pressure difference, not upward gravitational attraction."
PH293,Buoyancy applies only in water,"Thinks buoyant force doesn’t apply in other fluids like air, ignoring that the same principles apply to all fluids."
PH294,Buoyant force depends on object's shape,Believes that shape determines buoyant force rather than volume of displaced fluid.
PH295,Fluid flow requires energy input,"Assumes a pump or force is needed at all times for fluid to flow, ignoring that pressure and height differences can drive motion."
PH296,Flow rate increases with narrower pipe,Confuses speed with flow rate; does not understand that flow rate stays constant (continuity equation) while velocity increases.
PH297,Pressure increases in narrower regions,"Misinterprets Bernoulli's principle, believing higher speed corresponds to higher pressure instead of lower pressure."
PH298,Bernoulli’s equation applies everywhere,"Applies Bernoulli’s equation blindly, including across elevations or locations with friction or energy loss, where it’s not valid."
PH299,Torricelli’s theorem needs mass or force,"Thinks calculating exit speed of fluid requires knowledge of mass or force, instead of just height difference."
PH300,Pressure and speed increase together,"Fails to understand that fluid speed increases where pressure drops, not rises, when applying Bernoulli."
PH301,Conservation laws do not apply to fluids,"Thinks mass and energy conservation break down in flowing fluids, ignoring ideal flow assumptions."
