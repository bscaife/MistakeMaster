Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says pressure is the same at all depths. What’s the correct understanding?,Pressure is uniform throughout any fluid,Pressure increases with depth due to weight of the fluid above,Only temperature affects pressure in fluids,Pressure is greatest at the surface,B,"In fluids, pressure increases with depth according to P = P₀ + ρ·g·h. The deeper you go, the more fluid weight above you."
Which equation describes pressure at a given depth in a fluid?,P = m·g,P = ρ·g·h,P = F/m²,P = ½·ρ·v²,B,"Pressure in a fluid increases with depth: P = ρ·g·h, where ρ is density, g is gravity, and h is depth."
What happens to pressure as you go deeper underwater?,It decreases,It stays constant,It increases,It becomes negative,C,"The deeper you go, the more fluid is above you, adding more weight and increasing pressure."
Which of the following is true about fluid pressure?,It is always the same at all points,It depends only on fluid temperature,It increases with depth in a fluid,It decreases with fluid density,C,"Pressure in a fluid increases with depth, not just temperature or density."
Why is pressure greater at the bottom of a swimming pool than near the surface?,Because water is colder there,Because of atmospheric pressure,Because of the weight of water above,Because of salinity,C,Fluid pressure is caused by the weight of the fluid above a point. More fluid above = more pressure.
At what point in a fluid is pressure greatest?,At the surface,At the midpoint,At the bottom,Everywhere equally,C,Pressure increases with depth due to the weight of the fluid column above.
Two divers are at different depths. Who experiences more pressure?,The diver closer to the surface,Both experience the same pressure,The deeper diver,"Neither, since pressure is equalized",C,"The deeper you are, the more water is above you, increasing the pressure you feel."
What happens to pressure in a fluid when depth is doubled?,It stays the same,It is halved,It doubles,It becomes zero,C,"Since P = ρ·g·h, doubling depth h doubles the pressure from fluid weight."
Why might a student think pressure is the same at all depths?,They think gravity doesn’t affect liquids,They confuse pressure with temperature,They assume fluid spreads pressure equally,All of the above,D,Misconceptions about pressure uniformity and misunderstanding fluid behavior lead to this error.
What is a practical example of pressure increasing with depth?,Airplane flying high,Water boiling faster at altitude,Submarines needing strong hulls,Ice floating in water,C,"Submarines go deep where pressure increases significantly, requiring reinforced structures to withstand it."
