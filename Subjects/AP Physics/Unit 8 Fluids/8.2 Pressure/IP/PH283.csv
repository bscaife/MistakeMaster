Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says pressure depends only on force. What is the correct understanding?,Pressure increases with mass only,Pressure depends on force and area: P = F/A,Pressure is force times area,Pressure equals velocity over time,B,Pressure is defined as force divided by area: P = F/A. Both the magnitude of force and the area it's applied to matter.
Which action increases pressure the most?,Applying a large force over a large area,Applying a small force over a large area,Applying a large force over a small area,Increasing area while keeping force constant,C,"Since P = F/A, pressure increases when force is large and area is small."
Why do high heels exert more pressure than flat shoes?,They are heavier,They increase force,They reduce the area over which force is applied,They reduce gravity,C,"High heels focus the same weight on a much smaller area, increasing pressure."
Which unit correctly expresses pressure?,Newtons,Meters squared,Newtons per square meter (N/m²),Watts,C,"Pressure is measured in Pascals (Pa), which equals N/m²."
Which of the following would decrease pressure under a constant force?,Reducing surface area,Increasing surface area,Decreasing mass,Adding velocity,B,"Since pressure = F/A, increasing area while keeping force constant reduces pressure."
"If two people apply the same force but one uses a smaller surface area, who applies more pressure?",They apply the same pressure,The one with the larger area,The one with the smaller area,Neither applies pressure,C,Smaller area under the same force results in higher pressure: P = F/A.
What happens to pressure if both force and area double?,It doubles,It halves,It remains the same,It becomes zero,C,"P = F/A. If both numerator and denominator double, their ratio remains unchanged."
Which example illustrates the importance of surface area in pressure?,A nail entering wood point-first vs. flat-end,A train accelerating,Boiling water,Airplane flying,A,"The sharp tip has small area, increasing pressure and allowing the nail to penetrate the surface."
How does pressure change when a force is spread over a smaller contact area?,It increases,It decreases,It stays the same,It becomes negative,A,Decreasing area increases pressure when force is constant: P = F/A.
Why might a student ignore the role of area in pressure?,They think pressure only depends on weight,They confuse pressure with force,"They focus on gravity, not geometry",All of the above,D,"Students often associate pressure with only downward force, overlooking the mathematical role of area in P = F/A."
