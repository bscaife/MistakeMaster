Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH281,Pressure is the same at all depths,Fails to recognize that pressure increases with depth due to the weight of the fluid above.
PH282,Pressure acts only downward,Does not understand that fluid pressure acts equally in all directions at a point in a fluid.
PH283,Only force affects pressure,Ignores the role of surface area in calculating pressure; doesn't apply the formula P = F/A correctly.
PH284,Air pressure is only present when air is moving,"Thinks that still air doesn't exert pressure, rather than understanding atmospheric pressure exists regardless of motion."
PH285,Liquids exert more pressure than gases due to weight alone,"Overgeneralizes liquid density and weight, without considering compressibility and depth-related variation in gases."
PH286,Objects are crushed by fluid pressure only from above,"Fails to see that fluid pressure surrounds objects and acts in all directions, not just from the top."
PH287,Larger objects exert more pressure,"Confuses force with pressure, neglecting the inverse relationship between pressure and area."
