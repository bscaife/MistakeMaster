Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A submarine dives from 20 m to 50 m below sea level. What happens to the pressure on its hull?,It stays the same because the submarine is enclosed.,It decreases with depth.,It increases due to more air above.,It increases because more water is above.,D,"P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — greater h means more ρ·g·h added to P₀, so pressure increases with depth."
Why does a diver feel more pressure at 10 m depth than at the surface?,Water is heavier at that depth.,Gravity is stronger underwater.,More water above adds to pressure.,The diver displaces more fluid.,C,P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — pressure increases because h (depth) increases the water column above.
"Two identical tanks contain water, but Tank A is 1 m deep and Tank B is 3 m deep. Which has more pressure at the bottom?","Tank A, because pressure spreads out.","Tank B, because it has more water above.",They have equal pressure due to equal surface area.,"Tank A, because it’s shallower.",B,P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — greater h in Tank B gives higher pressure at the bottom.
"If you go deeper into a swimming pool, how does the pressure on your body change?",It increases because more water is above.,It stays the same after 1 meter.,It decreases because light is reduced.,It depends on the direction you're facing.,A,P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — pressure rises linearly with depth h due to weight of water above.
"In a lake, where is the water pressure highest?",Near the surface where the sun hits.,At the very bottom.,Halfway down the depth.,It is equal at all depths.,B,P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — max h at the bottom gives maximum pressure.
Two divers descend into freshwater and saltwater respectively to the same depth. Who experiences more pressure?,"Freshwater diver, because water is clearer.","Saltwater diver, due to higher ρ.",Both experience the same pressure.,"Freshwater diver, since ρ is lower.",B,"P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — saltwater has greater ρ, increasing pressure at same h."
Why does pressure increase as you go deeper in a fluid?,Temperature decreases.,Density increases with height.,More fluid weight presses down.,Buoyancy decreases.,C,"P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — increased depth adds fluid weight, raising pressure."
What is the pressure 5 m below the surface of a lake compared to 1 m depth?,"Smaller, because deeper means colder.","Equal, since both are in water.","Greater, due to more water above.","The same, pressure doesn’t change.",C,P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — pressure is higher at 5 m than 1 m due to larger h.
A fish swims from shallow to deep water. What force change does it experience?,No change in net force.,Decrease in gravity.,Increase in upward pressure force.,Increase in downward pressure force.,D,P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — deeper water exerts greater pressure force downward on the fish.
Which variable explains why pressure increases in water as you go deeper?,"g, gravitational strength","P₀, surface pressure","h, the depth below surface","v, velocity of water flow",C,"P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — pressure depends directly on h (depth), making it the key factor."
