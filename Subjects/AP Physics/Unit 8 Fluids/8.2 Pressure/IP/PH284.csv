Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says air pressure only exists when air is moving. What is the correct explanation?,Air pressure only forms during wind,"Air pressure exists due to the weight of the atmosphere, regardless of motion",Still air has no pressure,Air pressure only acts during storms,B,"Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of the air above, and it exists even when the air is perfectly still."
What causes atmospheric pressure?,Temperature,Moving air currents,The weight of the air above,Earth's magnetic field,C,Atmospheric pressure is due to the mass of the air pushing down from above under the influence of gravity.
Which device measures air pressure?,Thermometer,Anemometer,Barometer,Altimeter,C,"A barometer is used to measure air pressure, and it works even when air is not moving."
Which situation has air pressure?,In a classroom,In a vacuum chamber,In deep space,In a tube with no air,A,"Air pressure is present in any room with air due to the weight of the atmosphere, even without wind."
What would happen to atmospheric pressure if all air stopped moving?,It would disappear,It would remain the same,It would double,It would cause a vacuum,B,Air pressure is independent of wind. It's based on gravity and the amount of air above a surface.
Why does a sealed balloon expand at higher altitude?,Because wind pushes on it,Because gravity changes,Because air pressure outside is lower,Because heat from the Sun causes it,C,"At higher altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower, so the higher inside pressure makes the balloon expand."
What does still air do to the walls of a container?,Nothing,Pushes only downward,Applies equal pressure in all directions,Pushes only upward,C,"Still air exerts pressure in all directions due to molecular collisions, even without bulk motion."
Why do suction cups stick to a surface?,Because of moving air,Because of atmospheric pressure outside the cup,Because gravity pulls the cup inward,Because magnets are involved,B,Air pressure pushes the suction cup against the surface when the air inside is removed or reduced.
Which of the following statements is true about air pressure?,It requires moving air to exist,It is caused by the Sun,It acts even when air is at rest,It is strongest during storms only,C,"Air pressure is due to molecular motion and weight, and exists even when the air is not moving."
Why might a student think air pressure only exists when air is moving?,They associate wind with pressure,They think pressure means force only from motion,They misunderstand how molecules exert pressure,All of the above,D,"Many students connect pressure only with wind or moving air, not realizing stationary air still exerts pressure due to molecular collisions and gravity."
