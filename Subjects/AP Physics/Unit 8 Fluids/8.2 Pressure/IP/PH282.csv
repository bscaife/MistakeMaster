Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says pressure in fluids acts only downward. What’s the correct explanation?,Pressure is always downward because of gravity,Pressure in a fluid acts equally in all directions at a given point,Pressure acts sideways only in gases,Pressure has no direction,B,"In fluids at rest, pressure at a point acts equally in all directions — not just downward — due to particle collisions."
Why does fluid pressure act in all directions?,Because gravity pulls up and down,Because fluid particles are in random motion,Because density changes with height,Because pressure depends on temperature,B,"Fluid pressure is caused by particles colliding randomly in all directions, leading to isotropic pressure."
Which of the following is a demonstration that pressure acts in all directions?,Barometer reading,A submerged balloon expands equally in all directions,Weight of a floating object,Boiling water,B,"When submerged, pressure on a balloon is equal in all directions, showing uniform fluid pressure."
What happens to an object submerged in fluid if pressure only acted downward?,It would float easily,It would sink with constant speed,It would be crushed from above,It would experience no upward force,D,"If pressure acted only downward, buoyant force (from upward pressure difference) wouldn't exist — but it does."
What force results from pressure difference between top and bottom of a submerged object?,Gravitational force,Normal force,Buoyant force,Friction force,C,The upward buoyant force is due to greater pressure at the bottom of an object than at the top.
In which direction(s) does pressure act at a point inside a fluid?,Only downward,Only sideways,Equally in all directions,Only upward and downward,C,"In a fluid at rest, pressure at a point is exerted equally in all directions due to uniform particle motion."
Why do dam walls curve outward at the bottom?,To look stronger,To push against water pressure from below,To counteract horizontal pressure from fluid,Because pressure is lower at the top,C,Fluid pressure acts horizontally against dam walls. Greater pressure at depth requires more wall support outward.
How is fluid pressure different from weight?,"Pressure is only vertical, weight is all directions",Pressure is a scalar caused by collisions; weight is a vector from gravity,They are both caused by density,They are the same concept,B,"Pressure comes from isotropic molecular motion, while weight is a force vector due to gravity acting downward."
How does a fluid behave if pressure is applied from one side?,It flows away only downward,It flows away in all directions,It compresses instantly,It evaporates,B,Pressure applied to a fluid is transmitted in all directions — this is Pascal’s Principle.
Which principle supports that pressure acts in all directions in a fluid?,Archimedes’ Principle,Newton’s Second Law,Pascal’s Principle,Bernoulli’s Principle,C,Pascal’s Principle states that pressure applied to a fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions throughout the fluid.
