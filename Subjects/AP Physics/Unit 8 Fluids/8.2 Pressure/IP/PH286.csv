Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A metal cube is fully submerged in water and doesn’t touch the bottom. Which direction does the water exert pressure on it?,Only from above.,Only from below.,"From above and below, but not sides.",From all directions equally.,D,"P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — pressure at a point in a fluid acts in all directions, not just from the top."
Why doesn’t a fully submerged object move sideways if water pushes on it from the sides?,Water pressure is zero on the sides.,The object is too heavy.,The side pressures are equal and cancel.,Pressure only acts downward.,C,"P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — equal side pressures cancel out, producing no net horizontal force."
A glass bulb is crushed when evacuated and submerged. What best explains this?,Air inside pushes out too strongly.,Only water from above pushes down.,Water pressure is greater on top than sides.,Water pressure surrounds it and crushes it equally.,D,"Fluids exert pressure in all directions; with no internal pressure, surrounding pressure crushes the object."
An air bubble rises in water. Which direction is pressure applied?,Only from below.,Only from above.,From sides only.,"From all directions, more from below.",D,"P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — pressure increases with depth, so upward pressure is greater than downward."
Which best describes how pressure acts on a submerged can?,Pushes from above to crush it.,Pushes from above and below only.,Pushes only inward from the top.,Pushes inward from all sides.,D,"Fluid pressure acts equally in all directions at a given depth, not just downward."
Why does water leak out evenly when a hole is made in the side of a tank?,Pressure acts sideways as well as down.,Water seeks equilibrium.,Water only falls due to gravity.,There’s no pressure in a still tank.,A,P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — pressure at depth pushes out sideways and causes water to leak horizontally.
What direction does pressure act on a diver’s body at 10 m depth?,Only vertically down.,Only upward from below.,From all directions around the diver.,Only from sides.,C,"P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — pressure at depth acts isotropically, pressing inward from all directions."
Why does a submarine hull need to resist inward pressure from all directions?,Only top pressure causes collapse.,Water swirls create side forces.,Pressure inside pushes outward.,External pressure surrounds it completely.,D,Fluids exert pressure in all directions; the hull must resist inward force from all sides.
A ball filled with air sinks. Where is the greatest pressure?,On the sides.,On the top.,On the bottom.,Same all around at a given depth.,C,"P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — bottom is at greater h than top, so bottom pressure is highest."
How can fluid pressure create a net upward force on a floating object?,Side pressure creates upward force.,Top and bottom pressures cancel.,Greater pressure below pushes up.,Only surface tension holds it up.,C,"P = P₀ + ρ·g·h — bottom is deeper, so net pressure force is upward (buoyancy)."
