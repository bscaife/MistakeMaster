Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Two boxes with equal mass are placed on the floor. Box A has a larger bottom surface than Box B. Which exerts more pressure?,"Box A, because it's wider.","Box B, because it has smaller area.",Both exert the same pressure.,"Box A, because it looks heavier.",B,"P = F / A — both exert same force (weight), but smaller A gives higher P."
A person lies flat on snow vs. standing on their feet. Why do they sink more when standing?,Their mass increases when standing.,Pressure is greater because area is smaller.,The snow is softer under feet.,Lying down pushes harder.,B,"P = F / A — standing reduces A, increasing pressure and causing sinking."
Which will exert the least pressure on the ground?,A small box with a small bottom.,A tall heavy box with a narrow base.,A wide heavy box with large base.,A medium box with average area.,C,"P = F / A — wider base (larger A) spreads force, reducing pressure."
"Two people have the same weight. One wears flat shoes, the other wears high heels. Who exerts more pressure?",Person in flats.,They exert the same pressure.,Person in heels.,"Neither, pressure depends only on mass.",C,"P = F / A — heels have smaller contact area, increasing pressure."
Why do snowshoes prevent sinking in snow?,They add weight to the user.,"They increase contact area, lowering pressure.",They redistribute snow underfoot.,They increase the force downward.,B,P = F / A — increasing A reduces pressure on the snow.
"Two bricks exert the same force. One lies flat, the other stands on end. Which creates more pressure?",The one lying flat.,They produce equal pressure.,The one standing on end.,It depends on the height.,C,P = F / A — smaller base area on end increases pressure.
Why do tanks have wide treads?,To add more mass.,To increase weight.,To decrease pressure on the ground.,To crush the ground below.,C,P = F / A — increasing tread area reduces ground pressure.
Which factor affects pressure on a surface the most?,Volume of the object.,Mass only.,Surface area in contact.,Color of the object.,C,P = F / A — pressure depends on both F and A; larger A means less P.
"If two boxes weigh the same but have different areas, what determines which exerts more pressure?",The color of the box.,The shape of the top.,The area of the bottom.,The volume of the box.,C,P = F / A — smaller area on bottom means greater pressure.
Why does a knife cut better with a sharp edge?,It has more weight.,It has more mass.,It has less surface area at the point.,It has more length.,C,P = F / A — tiny A at blade tip concentrates force into high pressure.
