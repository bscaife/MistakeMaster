Two identical containers are filled with water to different heights. Container A has a depth of 1 m and B has 2 m. Which statement best describes the pressure at the bottom?,A,Container B has twice the pressure at the bottom as Container A.,True,,Both containers have the same pressure because they are identical in shape.,False,PH281,"Pressure depends only on the amount of water, not its height.",False,PH283,"Water pressure depends on container width, not depth.",False,PH281,"Fluid pressure increases with depth: P = ρ·g·h. Since depth doubles from A to B, pressure at the bottom of B is twice that at A."
A diver feels more pressure on their body as they descend deeper underwater. What causes this increase in pressure?,B,Pressure increases only from above as the diver goes deeper.,False,PH282,Pressure increases because water pushes equally from all directions at greater depth.,True,,"The diver gets heavier with depth, increasing pressure.",False,PH283,Only large animals can feel pressure at depth.,False,PH287,Pressure in fluids acts in all directions and increases with depth due to the weight of the fluid above. It’s not just downward.
Which situation shows that air pressure exists even when air isn’t moving?,C,A breeze makes leaves rustle.,False,PH284,An open window allows wind to blow in.,False,PH284,A suction cup sticks to a wall without airflow.,True,,A fan pushes air toward someone’s face.,False,PH284,"Air pressure exists even in still air. A suction cup stays because external air pressure pushes it against the wall, even though the air is not moving."
Why can a sealed empty can be crushed when the air inside is removed?,D,The can is crushed only from the top by gravity.,False,PH286,Air rushes in and increases internal pressure.,False,PH284,The mass of the can causes it to collapse.,False,PH283,The unbalanced external air pressure pushes from all sides.,True,,"When internal pressure is removed, the greater external air pressure crushes the can from all sides, not just from the top."
"Two blocks are placed on a table. Block A has a smaller surface area than Block B, but both have the same weight. Which block exerts more pressure?",A,"Block A, because pressure = force ÷ area and it has smaller area.",True,,"Block B, because larger blocks exert more pressure.",False,PH287,They exert the same pressure because they weigh the same.,False,PH283,"Pressure depends only on volume, not surface area.",False,PH283,"Pressure = force ÷ area. With equal force, a smaller area results in higher pressure. So Block A exerts more pressure."
Why does a dam have thicker walls at the bottom than at the top?,C,Water is heavier at the bottom due to gravity pulling harder.,False,PH283,Larger amounts of water at the bottom increase the weight on the dam.,False,PH287,"Water pressure increases with depth, requiring more strength lower down.",True,,"Pressure is the same throughout the dam, but more support is needed at the base.",False,PH281,"Fluid pressure increases with depth. The deeper part of the dam experiences more pressure, so it must be built thicker to withstand the force."
Which of the following best explains why your ears pop during a rapid change in altitude?,D,"You are moving faster, which increases air pressure.",False,PH284,Pressure is stronger inside your body than outside.,False,PH282,Only moving air creates pressure changes in your ears.,False,PH284,"Air pressure changes, and your body adjusts to match the surrounding pressure.",True,,"Air pressure exists even when air is still. A change in altitude alters the external pressure, and your body adjusts to maintain equilibrium, causing ears to pop."
A hydraulic press uses a small piston to lift a heavy object. What explains how this works?,A,"Pressure is transmitted equally through the fluid, multiplying the force on a larger piston.",True,,Larger pistons always create more pressure.,False,PH287,"Fluids flow downward, so the force increases naturally.",False,PH282,"Only gases can transmit pressure evenly, not liquids.",False,PH285,"Pascal’s principle states that pressure applied to a fluid is transmitted equally in all directions, allowing force multiplication on a larger piston."
Why might a person feel less buoyant at deeper depths?,B,The body becomes heavier at greater depth.,False,PH287,"The buoyant force remains the same, but pressure increases equally on all sides.",True,,"More water is pressing down from above, reducing upward force.",False,PH286,Only the top of the body experiences extra pressure.,False,PH286,Buoyant force doesn’t decrease with depth; pressure increases equally in all directions. The sensation of compression may be misinterpreted as less buoyancy.
"What is true about pressure in a closed fluid system, such as a sealed syringe?",C,Only the part nearest the piston feels increased pressure.,False,PH282,Gases in the syringe create uneven pressure distribution.,False,PH284,Applying pressure to one part increases pressure everywhere equally.,True,,Pressure acts only downward inside the syringe.,False,PH282,"According to Pascal’s principle, pressure applied to a confined fluid is distributed equally throughout the fluid."
