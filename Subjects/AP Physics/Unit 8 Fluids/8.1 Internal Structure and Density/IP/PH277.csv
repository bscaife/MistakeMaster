Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says mass and volume are the same. What’s the correct explanation?,Mass and volume are identical for all materials,Mass is the amount of matter; volume is the space it occupies,Mass is calculated using volume,Mass equals volume times height,B,"Mass and volume are different properties. Mass is the amount of matter, while volume is the space the object takes up."
Which of the following is an extensive property?,Density,Temperature,Mass,Color,C,"Mass depends on the amount of material, making it an extensive property. Volume is also extensive."
"If two objects have the same volume but different masses, what can you say about their densities?",They are the same,The heavier object is less dense,The heavier object is more dense,Density depends only on shape,C,"Density = mass/volume. Same volume, more mass = greater density."
What are the SI units for mass and volume?,"Mass = mL, Volume = kg","Mass = kg, Volume = m³","Mass = g/cm³, Volume = g","Mass = N, Volume = m",B,Mass is measured in kilograms (kg); volume is measured in cubic meters (m³).
Which example shows mass and volume are not interchangeable?,A balloon and a rock with the same volume,Two cups of water,A liter of air and a liter of water,Both A and C,D,"Objects can have equal volume but very different mass, depending on their density (A and C)."
How does changing volume affect mass?,Volume and mass always increase together,More volume means more mass,Changing volume doesn’t always change mass,Volume equals mass times gravity,C,"Mass and volume are not directly linked unless density is constant. You can change volume without changing mass (e.g., compressing a sponge)."
Which of these is a correct comparison?,Mass and volume are both force-related,Volume measures matter; mass measures space,Mass = density × volume,Mass = volume²,C,Mass can be calculated using density and volume: m = ρ·V.
"If an object is compressed and its volume decreases, what happens to its mass?",It decreases,It stays the same,It increases,It becomes zero,B,Mass is conserved. Compressing an object changes volume but not mass.
Which of the following objects has the most mass?,A large beach ball filled with air,A small lead ball,A balloon and a sponge with equal volume,Need more information about density,D,"To determine mass from volume, you also need the object's density."
Why might a student confuse mass with volume?,Because large objects often feel heavy,Because volume and mass are measured in the same unit,Because density is hard to understand,Because shape changes mass,A,"People often assume large volume means more mass, but a large object can have low mass if its density is small."
