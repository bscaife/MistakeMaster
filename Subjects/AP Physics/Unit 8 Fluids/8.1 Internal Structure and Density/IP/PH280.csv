Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says ideal fluids and real fluids behave the same. What’s the correct explanation?,Ideal fluids are perfect models with no viscosity or compressibility,Real fluids are always ideal in practice,Ideal fluids are more realistic than real fluids,Real fluids cannot flow,A,"Ideal fluids are defined as having no viscosity and no compressibility, unlike real fluids which exhibit both effects."
Which property is ignored in an ideal fluid model?,Density,Viscosity,Mass,Volume,B,"Ideal fluids are assumed to have no viscosity, even though real fluids resist flow due to internal friction."
Why can ideal fluids be compressed more easily than real fluids?,They are less dense,They are defined as incompressible,They have infinite compressibility,They have higher viscosity,C,"Ideal fluids are assumed incompressible, while real fluids can change density under pressure."
Which statement best describes viscosity in fluids?,Viscosity is friction within the fluid,Viscosity is mass per volume,Viscosity is gravity acting on the fluid,Viscosity equals compressibility,D,Viscosity measures internal resistance to flow. It is absent in ideal fluids but present in real fluids.
A student claims viscosity has no effect on fluid motion. What is the correct understanding?,Viscosity slows motion and causes energy loss,Viscosity increases flow rate,Viscosity doesn’t exist in real fluids,Viscosity is the same as density,A,"Real fluids experience viscous drag, which resists flow and dissipates energy as heat."
Which assumption is used in Bernoulli’s equation for ideal fluids?,Constant viscosity and variable density,Constant density and no viscosity,Zero pressure everywhere,Fluids are weightless,B,Bernoulli’s principle assumes ideal fluid behavior with incompressibility and no viscosity.
Why can’t real fluids perfectly obey Bernoulli’s equation?,Real fluids have no density,Real fluids lose energy due to viscosity,Real fluids have no mass,Real fluids ignore pressure,C,"Bernoulli’s equation is exact for ideal fluids, but in real fluids viscosity causes energy loss, making it approximate."
A student says compressibility doesn’t matter for fluids. What is the correct explanation?,Compressibility is zero for real fluids,Fluids can compress under pressure; ideal fluids are assumed incompressible,Compressibility equals viscosity,Compressibility means fluids disappear,D,"Real fluids can change density under pressure, but ideal fluids are modeled as incompressible."
Which of these is true for ideal fluids?,No viscosity and no compressibility,High viscosity and high compressibility,Same behavior as real fluids,Density always infinite,A,"Ideal fluids are defined as inviscid and incompressible, unlike real fluids."
Why are ideal fluids useful in physics?,They provide a simple model that ignores viscosity and compressibility,They exactly match real fluids in experiments,They describe solids and gases equally,They prove fluids cannot exist in reality,C,Ideal fluids are not real substances but provide a simplified model to derive useful equations like Bernoulli’s law.
