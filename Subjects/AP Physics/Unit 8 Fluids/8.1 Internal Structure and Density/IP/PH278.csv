Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says air has no density. What’s the correct understanding?,Air is too light to have mass,Air has no volume so it has no density,"Air has mass and volume, so it has density",Only solids have density,C,"Air is made of particles with mass and occupies space, so it has density: ρ = m/V."
What is the approximate density of air at sea level?,0 kg/m³,1.2 kg/m³,10 kg/m³,1000 kg/m³,B,"The typical density of air at sea level is around 1.2 kg/m³, which is measurable and nonzero."
Which of the following materials has the lowest density?,Air,Water,Aluminum,Lead,A,Air is a gas and has a much lower density compared to liquids and solids.
"If air had no density, which of the following could not happen?",Wind would blow,Hot air balloons would rise,Air pressure would exist,All of the above,D,"Air pressure, wind, and buoyancy in air require air to have mass and density."
Why does a balloon rise in air?,Because it weighs less,Because it has lower density than air,Because it has no mass,Because air has no pressure,B,"A balloon rises when its average density is less than the surrounding air, which has its own measurable density."
Which experiment demonstrates that air has mass?,Pouring water into a cup,Weighing a balloon before and after inflation,Observing a rock fall,Boiling water,B,"Inflated balloons are heavier than uninflated ones, showing that air adds mass and therefore density."
Why might a student think air has no density?,Because air is invisible and feels light,Because air can’t be weighed,Because air doesn’t exert a force,Because gases don’t exist,A,"Air is invisible and doesn’t feel heavy, but it is made of particles with mass, giving it density."
What is density a measure of?,How heavy something is,The space something takes up,Mass per unit volume,Volume per unit mass,C,Density is the ratio of mass to volume: ρ = m/V. All substances with mass and volume have density.
Which observation confirms that air has density?,Water boils at 100°C,An inflated tire is heavier,Oil floats on water,Salt dissolves in water,B,"An inflated tire is heavier because it contains air, confirming that air has mass and volume (and thus density)."
"If air had no mass or density, which of the following would be impossible?",Hurricanes,Breathing,Barometers measuring pressure,All of the above,D,"Air density is essential for pressure systems, respiration, and atmospheric dynamics like weather."
