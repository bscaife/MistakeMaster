Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH274,Density is the same as weight,"Confuses density (mass per unit volume) with weight, which depends on gravitational force."
PH275,Density depends on amount,"Thinks that more of a substance increases its density, rather than recognizing density as an intensive property."
PH276,Objects float if they are lighter,"Believes that absolute weight determines floating, ignoring that density relative to fluid is the key factor."
PH277,Mass and volume are interchangeable,Fails to distinguish between how much matter is in an object and how much space it occupies.
PH278,Air has no density,Assumes gases are 'weightless' or 'massless' despite having measurable density.
PH279,Solids can be compressed like fluids,Ignores that solids have fixed structure and negligible compressibility compared to fluids.
PH280,Ideal fluids have the same behavior as real fluids,"Does not understand that ideal fluids ignore viscosity and compressibility, unlike real-world substances."
