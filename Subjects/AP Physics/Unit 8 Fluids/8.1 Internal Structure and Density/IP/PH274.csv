Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says density and weight are the same. What is the correct understanding?,Density and weight are both types of mass,Density is mass per volume; weight is force due to gravity,Weight equals density times gravity,"Density changes with height, like weight",B,"Density is ρ = m/V. Weight is W = m·g. They are different quantities: one is intrinsic, the other depends on gravity."
What are the correct units for density?,Newtons (N),kg,kg/m³,m/s²,C,"Density is defined as mass divided by volume, so the correct SI unit is kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³)."
Which of the following statements is true?,Objects with more density always weigh more,Density and weight are always directly proportional,Weight depends on gravitational field; density does not,Density depends on height above Earth,C,"Weight = m·g and varies with g. Density is m/V and depends only on the material, not location."
"If you take an object to the Moon, what happens to its density and weight?",Both decrease,"Density increases, weight decreases","Density stays the same, weight decreases",Both remain constant,C,"Density is intrinsic (mass/volume) and unaffected by gravity. Weight depends on g, which is lower on the Moon."
Which formula defines density?,ρ = m·g,ρ = F/A,ρ = m/V,ρ = m·a,C,Density (ρ) is defined as mass divided by volume.
Which describes the difference between mass and weight?,Mass changes with gravity; weight does not,Mass is a force; weight is a scalar,Mass is constant; weight changes with gravity,There is no difference,C,Mass is a measure of matter and doesn’t change. Weight is the force from gravity acting on mass: W = m·g.
Which of these is NOT true about density?,It depends on both mass and volume,It changes when you go to space,It’s an intrinsic property,It is unrelated to gravitational force,B,Density is intrinsic and does not change with location. It depends only on the substance’s mass and volume.
How is weight defined?,W = m/V,W = m·g,W = ρ·V,W = m·a²,B,"Weight is a force calculated as W = m·g, where g is the local gravitational field strength."
"If two objects have the same weight but different volumes, what can you say about their densities?",The one with larger volume has higher density,They must have the same density,The one with smaller volume has higher density,Volume does not affect density,C,"With equal weights and different volumes, the object with smaller volume must have higher density (ρ = m/V)."
Why might a student confuse density with weight?,Because dense objects feel heavy,Because mass and weight are always equal,Because volume is irrelevant in physics,Because weight is used to calculate density,A,"Dense objects often feel heavy, leading to confusion. But density is m/V, while weight depends on gravity (W = m·g)."
