Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says adding more of a substance increases its density. What is the correct understanding?,Density increases with more mass,Density is an intensive property and doesn’t depend on amount,More substance always means higher density,Density and volume are unrelated,B,"Density (ρ = m/V) is intensive, meaning it stays constant regardless of how much of the substance is present, as long as the substance is uniform."
Which of the following is an intensive property?,Mass,Volume,Density,Weight,C,"Density doesn’t depend on the quantity of material, only on the type of substance."
"If you double the mass and double the volume of a material, what happens to its density?",It doubles,It halves,It stays the same,It becomes zero,C,"Density = mass/volume. If both mass and volume double, their ratio (density) remains unchanged."
What happens to the density of a liquid if you pour more of it into a container?,It increases,It decreases,It stays the same,It depends on the shape of the container,C,Density is independent of the quantity of material. Adding more doesn’t change the mass-to-volume ratio.
Which of the following changes would not affect the density of a uniform object?,Changing its shape,Compressing it,Cutting it in half,Heating it,C,"Cutting a uniform object in half reduces both mass and volume equally, so density remains unchanged."
"Why is it incorrect to say ‘this object is heavy, so it must have high density’?",Because density is related to energy,"Because density requires volume, not just mass",Because heaviness has no units,Because weight and density are inverses,B,Density requires both mass and volume. A heavy object could be large with low density.
"If a cube of gold is cut in half, what happens to the density of each half?",It doubles,It decreases,It stays the same,It becomes zero,C,"Both mass and volume are halved, so the ratio (density) remains unchanged."
Which of these would indicate a misunderstanding of density?,"The more iron you have, the more mass it has","If I get more copper, its density goes up",Lead is denser than aluminum,Equal volumes of different materials can weigh differently,B,"More copper means more mass and volume, but the density (mass/volume) remains the same for the same substance."
What is meant by saying ‘density is an intensive property’?,It changes with gravitational field,It varies depending on sample size,It remains constant regardless of amount,It depends only on weight,C,Intensive properties like density do not depend on how much of a substance you have.
Why might a student incorrectly believe that more substance means more density?,Because heavier objects often feel denser,Because mass equals density,Because volume doesn’t matter,Because gravity affects density,A,"Perception of weight can lead to confusion. However, density is based on mass and volume, not just mass."
