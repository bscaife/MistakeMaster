Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says solids can be compressed like fluids. What is the correct understanding?,Solids compress as easily as gases,Solids compress more than liquids,Solids resist compression due to fixed atomic structure,Solids are more compressible in vacuum,C,"Solids have a rigid atomic structure, which gives them very low compressibility compared to fluids."
Which of the following best describes the compressibility of solids?,Very high,Moderate,Negligible,Same as liquids,C,"Solids resist volume changes under pressure due to closely packed particles, making them nearly incompressible."
What causes fluids to be more compressible than solids?,Higher density,Weaker intermolecular forces and more particle spacing,Higher surface tension,Lower boiling points,B,"Fluids have loosely bound particles that can be pushed closer together, unlike the rigid structure in solids."
Which state of matter is most compressible?,Solid,Liquid,Gas,Plasma,C,"Gases have particles far apart, allowing significant volume reduction under pressure."
When is a solid likely to compress noticeably?,Under everyday pressure,Never,Under extreme pressure like inside Earth’s core,When cooled,C,"Solids compress only under immense pressures, such as deep inside planetary interiors."
Which property makes solids different from fluids in terms of compressibility?,Their mass,Their temperature,Their fixed shape and volume,Their ability to expand,C,"Solids maintain fixed shape and volume due to rigid atomic bonding, unlike fluids which flow and compress."
Which experiment demonstrates that solids resist compression?,Squeezing a metal block,Blowing into a balloon,Pouring water into a cup,Heating a gas in a cylinder,A,Pressing a solid object like metal shows it does not noticeably reduce in volume under pressure.
Why don’t solids compress easily?,Because they have no atoms,Because their particles are already tightly packed,Because they are weightless,Because they are always cold,B,"In solids, particles are closely packed and cannot move much closer together, making them nearly incompressible."
What does the bulk modulus of a substance describe?,How it bends,Its density,Its compressibility,Its viscosity,C,"The bulk modulus measures a material's resistance to compression — high in solids, lower in fluids."
Why might students confuse compressibility of solids and fluids?,They’ve never tested it experimentally,They assume all matter behaves the same under pressure,They confuse solid density with compressibility,All of the above,D,"Lack of tactile experience, conflating properties, and generalized assumptions lead to this misconception."
