Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says objects float if they are lighter. What is the correct explanation?,Floating depends only on weight,Objects float if they weigh less than water,Objects float if their density is less than the fluid's,Objects float only if they are small,C,Whether an object floats depends on its density relative to the fluid. Objects with lower density than the fluid displace enough fluid to support their weight.
Which of these best determines whether an object floats?,The object’s weight,The fluid’s surface tension,The object’s density compared to the fluid’s,The object's color,C,An object floats if its density is less than the density of the fluid it’s in.
What does Archimedes’ principle say about floating?,Objects float if they are small enough,Objects float if their shape is round,Buoyant force equals the weight of displaced fluid,Buoyant force equals the object's weight,C,Archimedes’ principle states that the upward buoyant force is equal to the weight of fluid displaced by the object.
"Two cubes of the same size are placed in water. One floats, the other sinks. Why?",The floating one is lighter,The sinking one is darker in color,The floating one has lower density,The sinking one has less mass,C,"The floating cube has a lower density than water, allowing it to displace enough fluid to stay afloat."
Which of the following objects would float in water (density = 1.0 g/cm³)?,An object with density 0.8 g/cm³,An object with density 1.5 g/cm³,An object with density 1.0 g/cm³,An object with zero weight,A,Objects float if their density is less than the fluid’s. A density of 0.8 g/cm³ is less than that of water.
A heavy ship floats on water. Why?,Its weight is evenly distributed,It has engines that push upward,Its average density is less than water,It’s made of metal,C,"Although heavy, the ship’s large volume reduces its average density below that of water, allowing it to float."
What does ‘lighter’ usually refer to in floating misconceptions?,Lower density,Lower weight,Smaller volume,Higher temperature,B,"Students often confuse ‘lighter’ (lower weight) with density. But density, not absolute weight, determines floating."
"If a 500 g object and a 5 g object both float in water, what must be true?",They are both light enough,They both displace less fluid,They both have lower density than water,They both have equal volume,C,"Floating depends on density, not mass. Both objects must have a density less than water to float."
How does shape affect floating?,Rounder objects float better,Only flat objects float,"Shape affects volume, and therefore density",Shape is irrelevant,C,"Shape can affect how much water is displaced, which affects the object’s average density and its ability to float."
Why does a steel nail sink while a steel ship floats?,The ship has less mass,The nail is denser than water,The ship’s average density is less than water,The nail is not hollow,C,"Although made of the same material, the ship’s hollow design lowers its average density below water’s, allowing it to float."
