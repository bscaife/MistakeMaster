"Two cubes of the same size are made of different materials. Cube A has a mass of 2 kg, and Cube B has a mass of 4 kg. Which statement best compares their densities?",A,Cube B has twice the density of Cube A.,TRUE,,Both cubes have the same density because they are the same size.,FALSE,PH274,Cube A is less dense because it has less weight.,FALSE,PH274,Density cannot be compared unless they are placed in water.,FALSE,PH280,"Density is defined as mass divided by volume. Since both cubes have the same volume, the one with greater mass (Cube B) has greater density. So: density = mass ÷ volume → B is twice as dense."
A student says that a balloon rises because it is 'lighter' than air. Which explanation more accurately reflects the concept of buoyancy?,B,The balloon floats because it has less mass than the surrounding air.,FALSE,PH274,"The balloon is less dense than the air it displaces, causing an upward net force.",TRUE,,The balloon rises because gravity does not act on gases.,FALSE,PH278,"The balloon has more volume than the air, so it is pushed upward.",FALSE,PH277,"Buoyant force depends on density, not just mass. A balloon rises because its density is lower than that of air, creating upward buoyant force as described by Archimedes' principle."
A rock sinks in water while a wooden block of the same size floats. What can you conclude about their densities?,C,The wood floats because it is hollow inside.,FALSE,PH280,"The rock is heavier, so it sinks regardless of volume.",FALSE,PH274,"The rock is denser than water, while the wood is less dense than water.",TRUE,,Both objects have the same density because they are the same size.,FALSE,PH275,Sinking or floating depends on density relative to water. Equal volume does not mean equal density. The rock has greater density than water; the wood has less.
Which statement correctly describes the difference between mass and volume?,D,An object’s weight determines its volume.,FALSE,PH274,Mass and volume are interchangeable depending on the object.,FALSE,PH277,More mass always means more volume.,FALSE,PH275,Mass is the amount of matter; volume is the space it occupies.,TRUE,,"Mass is a measure of matter; volume is spatial extent. They are related via density, but not interchangeable. Two objects can have the same mass and different volumes or vice versa."
A sealed empty plastic bottle is weighed and then crushed. Its mass stays the same. What best explains this?,A,"The volume changed but the mass stayed constant, so density increased.",TRUE,,The bottle lost weight when crushed because it got smaller.,FALSE,PH274,"Solids cannot change volume, so this must be a measurement error.",FALSE,PH279,"Mass depends on size, so the new mass must be lower.",FALSE,PH275,"Crushing changes volume but not mass. Since density = mass ÷ volume, reducing volume while keeping mass constant increases density. Solids can’t compress easily, but plastic can."
A metal cube and a plastic cube have equal masses but different volumes. What can be concluded about their densities?,A,The metal cube is denser because it has less volume for the same mass.,TRUE,,Both cubes have equal density because their mass is the same.,FALSE,PH274,Both cubes have equal density because their mass is the same.,FALSE,PH274,Density cannot be compared without knowing their weights.,FALSE,PH274,"Density = mass ÷ volume. Equal mass and smaller volume means greater density. The metal cube, being smaller but equally massive, must be denser."
A student claims that compressed air has no mass because it is invisible. Which response correctly addresses the misunderstanding?,B,Air has no mass unless it is in liquid form.,FALSE,PH278,"Air has mass and density, measurable by the force it exerts in a container.",TRUE,,Air has no mass unless it is in liquid form.,FALSE,PH278,Air cannot be compressed because gases do not occupy space.,FALSE,PH279,"Air is made of particles with mass and can exert pressure. Despite being invisible, it has both mass and density and can be compressed in a container."
"If a fluid is ideal, which property does it most likely exhibit?",C,It behaves exactly like water under all conditions.,FALSE,PH280,It behaves exactly like water under no conditions.,FALSE,PH280,It flows without resistance or energy loss.,TRUE,,"It changes density with temperature, like real fluids.",FALSE,PH280,"Ideal fluids are a theoretical model. They are incompressible and flow without internal resistance (viscosity), unlike real fluids which lose energy due to friction."
Which of the following best explains why steel sinks in water but some ships made of steel can float?,D,Steel floats when shaped like a bowl because it's lighter than water.,FALSE,PH276,Steel floats when shaped like a bowl because it's lighter than water.,FALSE,PH276,Steel becomes less dense when heated during construction.,FALSE,PH280,Ships are large enough to displace more water than their weight.,TRUE,,"Floating depends on average density. A ship's shape displaces enough water to generate upward buoyant force greater than its weight, even if the material itself sinks."
A student argues that weight and density are the same because heavier objects always feel denser. What is a better explanation?,A,"Density is a ratio of mass to volume, independent of gravitational force.",TRUE,,Density is weight divided by height.,FALSE,PH277,Density is weight divided by mass.,FALSE,PH277,Heavier objects feel denser due to their thickness.,FALSE,PH275,"Weight depends on gravity, but density is mass ÷ volume. Two objects with the same weight can have different densities if their volumes differ."
