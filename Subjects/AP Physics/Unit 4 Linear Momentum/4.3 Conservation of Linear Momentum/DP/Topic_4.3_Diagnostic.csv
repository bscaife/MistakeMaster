Two carts— m₁ and m₂— collide elastically. Which quantities are conserved?,B,Only momentum.,FALSE,PH154,Momentum and kinetic energy.,TRUE,,Only kinetic energy.,FALSE,PH154,Only velocity.,FALSE,PH150,Elastic collisions conserve both momentum and KE.
A 2 kg cart moving at 3 m/s collides elastically with a 3 kg stationary cart. What is total momentum before?,A,6 kg·m/s,TRUE,,9 kg·m/s,FALSE,PH149,0 kg·m/s,FALSE,PH150,Cannot determine.,FALSE,PH150,Only moving cart: p = m·v = 2·3 = 6 kg·m/s
Which expression defines conservation of momentum for two objects colliding?,C,m₁v₁ = m₂v₂,FALSE,PH148,m₁ + m₂ = constant,FALSE,PH152,m₁v₁ₒ + m₂v₂ₒ = m₁v₁f + m₂v₂f,TRUE,,v₁f + v₂f = v₁ₒ + v₂ₒ,FALSE,PH151,Total momentum before = total after in isolated system
A bullet embeds in a block. What type of collision is this?,B,Elastic,FALSE,PH154,Perfectly inelastic,TRUE,,Explosion,FALSE,PH153,Partially elastic,FALSE,PH154,Sticking → perfectly inelastic: max KE loss
Two carts stick together after collision. How to find final velocity?,D,Use energy conservation.,FALSE,PH154,Add their kinetic energies.,FALSE,PH154,Use v_avg = (v₁ + v₂)/2,FALSE,PH151,Use p_total = (m₁ + m₂)·v_f,TRUE,,m₁v₁ + m₂v₂ = (m₁ + m₂)v_f → solve for v_f
A 1 kg ball at 4 m/s hits 2 kg ball at rest. After— ball 1 is at rest. What is velocity of ball 2?,A,v = 2 m/s,TRUE,,v = 4 m/s,FALSE,PH154,v = 1.5 m/s,FALSE,PH150,v = 0,FALSE,PH151,Momentum conserved: 1·4 = 2·v → v = 2
Why does a smaller mass accelerate more in recoil collisions?,C,Because it exerts more force.,FALSE,PH154,Because it has more momentum.,FALSE,PH138,Because it needs higher velocity to conserve momentum.,TRUE,,Because it loses kinetic energy.,FALSE,PH151,p = m·v → smaller m needs larger v to balance momentum
Two objects collide. One speeds up— the other slows down. Total momentum is—,D,Zero.,FALSE,PH150,Destroyed.,FALSE,PH153,Equal to their kinetic energy.,FALSE,PH154,Conserved as a vector sum.,TRUE,,Individual speeds change— but total momentum remains
What distinguishes an explosion from a collision?,B,Energy is lost.,FALSE,PH154,One object breaks into several pieces.,TRUE,,Momentum is destroyed.,FALSE,PH150,Objects stick together.,FALSE,PH151,Explosions begin with one object— end with many; still conserve momentum.
What is required for momentum to be conserved?,C,Equal masses.,FALSE,PH152,Equal speeds.,FALSE,PH150,No external forces.,TRUE,,Equal energies.,FALSE,PH154,Only isolated systems (∑Fₑₓₜ = 0) conserve momentum.
