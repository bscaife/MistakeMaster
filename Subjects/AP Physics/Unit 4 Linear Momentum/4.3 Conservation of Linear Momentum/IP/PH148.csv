Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
When is momentum conserved in a system?,Only when all objects move at constant velocity,When net external force on the system is zero,Only when energy is also conserved,When velocity of the center of mass is changing,B,Momentum is conserved when there are no external forces acting on the system.
A student says 'constant velocity means momentum is conserved.' What’s the correction?,Momentum is conserved even if velocity changes,Velocity must be constant in every direction,"Conservation depends on external forces, not motion type",Momentum depends only on energy,C,"Momentum conservation is about the forces on the system, not whether velocity is constant."
Which situation does NOT conserve momentum?,Two skaters push off each other on ice,Two carts collide on a frictionless track,A car slows down due to braking,A rocket fires in space and recoils,C,"Braking involves an external force (friction), so momentum is not conserved."
What is the real requirement for momentum conservation?,Constant velocity of each object,Equal mass of all components,No net external force acting on the system,No energy loss,C,Momentum is conserved if the system is isolated from external forces.
Why is constant velocity not required for momentum conservation?,Because momentum is always increasing,Because impulse replaces velocity,Because objects can accelerate internally and still conserve total system momentum,Because mass doesn’t change,C,"Internal forces can change individual velocities, but total momentum stays constant if no net external force exists."
Which of the following would prevent momentum conservation?,Elastic collision on a frictionless surface,Two cars colliding with no outside push,A parachute opening in midair,An astronaut floating in deep space,C,"Air resistance is an external force, so momentum is not conserved in that system."
A student says 'momentum stays the same only when speed is constant.' What’s the better explanation?,Speed does not affect momentum,Momentum only changes with friction,"Momentum changes when net force acts, not just when speed changes",Momentum can change even when at rest,C,"Momentum is a product of mass and velocity, and conservation depends on force, not just speed."
"A 3 kg object moves at 5 m/s. If no external force acts, what happens to its momentum?",It stays at 15 kg·m/s,It drops to zero,It increases steadily,It becomes negative,A,"With no net external force, momentum stays constant: p = 3×5 = 15 kg·m/s."
A 2 kg cart at 4 m/s hits a wall and stops. What caused momentum to not be conserved?,The cart was too light,The wall applied an external force,The velocity changed too quickly,The impulse was zero,B,Momentum is not conserved for the cart alone because the wall exerted an external force.
A 4 kg object collides with a 6 kg object. There is no friction. What is true?,Momentum is not conserved unless velocity stays the same,Momentum is conserved because there is no external force,Momentum is zero after collision,Energy replaces momentum,B,No friction = isolated system → momentum is conserved regardless of velocity changes.
