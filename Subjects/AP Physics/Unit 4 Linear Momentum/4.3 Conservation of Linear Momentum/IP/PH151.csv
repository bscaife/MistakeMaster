Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"In an explosion, what must be conserved?",Velocity of each part,Momentum of the system,Energy of each object,Direction of motion,B,"Total momentum is conserved before and after the explosion, even if individual parts move differently."
A student says total momentum after an explosion is always zero. What’s the mistake?,Momentum is only zero if speed is zero,Momentum is always negative,Total momentum depends on the initial motion of the system,Momentum is not conserved,C,"If the system had initial momentum before the explosion, it must have the same total afterward."
When does total momentum equal zero in an explosion?,"Always, because motion cancels",Only if the system was initially at rest,When energy is not conserved,Whenever objects are equal mass,B,"If the center of mass was initially at rest, total momentum is zero before and after."
"If a moving object explodes, what is the total momentum after?",Zero,Equal to the total energy,Equal to the original momentum before explosion,Equal to the lightest object’s momentum,C,"Momentum is conserved, so the system keeps its total momentum from before the explosion."
Two pieces fly apart from an explosion. Their individual momenta are...,Zero,Equal in direction and size,"Equal in magnitude, opposite in direction if initial momentum was zero",Randomly assigned,C,"To conserve zero total momentum, momenta of parts must be equal and opposite."
A cart moving at 2 m/s explodes. What must be true of the fragments?,They move in opposite directions at the same speed,Their combined momentum equals the cart’s original momentum,They must all stop,Their total energy is zero,B,Momentum is conserved in the system. The total momentum remains unchanged.
Which of the following best describes momentum conservation in explosions?,Each object’s momentum must be zero,Momentum is always negative,"The system's total momentum is constant, regardless of internal forces",Momentum increases as pieces fly apart,C,Internal forces can’t change the system’s total momentum—it remains constant.
A 6 kg cart moves at 2 m/s and explodes into two 3 kg pieces. One goes left at 1 m/s. Other's velocity?,5 m/s,3 m/s,1 m/s,2 m/s,A,Initial p = 12. One piece: 3×(–1) = –3 → other must be +15 → v = 15 ÷ 3 = 5 m/s
An object at rest explodes into 2 kg left at 4 m/s and 1 kg right. What’s velocity of right piece?,8 m/s,4 m/s,2 m/s,0 m/s,A,Initial p = 0 → total after = 0 → 2×(–4) + 1×v = 0 → v = +8 m/s
A 10 kg object moving at 1 m/s explodes into two 5 kg parts. One moves backward at 1 m/s. Other?,1 m/s forward,3 m/s forward,0 m/s,2 m/s forward,D,Initial p = 10. One part: –5 → other: 15 ÷ 5 = 3 m/s
