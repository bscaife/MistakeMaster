Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"When two objects move in different directions after a collision, is momentum conserved?","No, only energy is conserved","Yes, momentum is conserved as a vector",Only if the speeds are equal,Only in elastic collisions,B,Momentum is a vector and can be conserved in multiple directions as long as no net external force acts.
Why is momentum conserved even when directions differ?,Because velocity is a scalar,Because force is balanced,Because vector components add up to a constant total,Because energy is also conserved,C,"Momentum conservation means the total x- and y-components before = total after, even with changing directions."
Which best explains why momentum can be conserved in 2D motion?,Only mass changes,Vector components are added separately,Velocity is always positive,Forces cancel out,B,"Momentum is conserved independently in each direction (e.g., x and y components)."
Which statement is true about the total momentum of a system?,It must stay in one direction,It must be zero in all cases,It can be split into components in different directions,It increases with collisions,C,"Total momentum is a vector and can be split into x and y components, both of which are conserved separately."
Two identical carts collide and move apart at angles. What must be true?,Momentum is lost,Total momentum is conserved as a vector sum,Only speed matters,Direction doesn’t matter,B,"Momentum is conserved in all directions, not just one."
What is a student misunderstanding if they say momentum is not conserved in 2D collisions?,They forgot to convert to energy,They are using relative speed instead of vectors,"They are adding momenta as scalars, not vectors",They didn’t subtract force from time,C,"Adding momenta as scalars ignores direction, leading to the false conclusion that momentum isn’t conserved."
Which of the following quantities is conserved in both x and y directions in a closed system?,Velocity,Kinetic energy,Momentum,Impulse,C,Momentum is a vector and is conserved in each dimension separately in an isolated system.
Two objects each with 2 kg move at 3 m/s at 90° angles. What is the magnitude of total momentum?,6 kg·m/s,3√2 kg·m/s,6√2 kg·m/s,0 kg·m/s,C,Each has p = 6 kg·m/s; total vector sum = √(6² + 6²) = 6√2 kg·m/s.
A 3 kg object moves right at 4 m/s and another 3 kg object moves left at 4 m/s. Total momentum?,0 kg·m/s,12 kg·m/s,6 kg·m/s,24 kg·m/s,A,3×4 + 3×(–4) = 12 – 12 = 0 kg·m/s. Momentum cancels due to direction.
A 1 kg object at 3 m/s north collides with 1 kg at 4 m/s east. What is the system’s initial momentum magnitude?,1 kg·m/s,5 kg·m/s,7 kg·m/s,√25 kg·m/s,D,p = √(3² + 4²) = √9 + 16 = √25 = 5 kg·m/s.
