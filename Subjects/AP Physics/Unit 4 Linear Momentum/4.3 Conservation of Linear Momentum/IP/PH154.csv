Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which of the following is required to conserve momentum?,No energy loss,Equal masses,No net external force,Elastic collision,C,Momentum is conserved in all isolated systems regardless of energy conservation.
Why is momentum conserved in inelastic collisions?,Because energy is also conserved,Because no external force acts,Because masses are equal,Because impulse is zero,B,"Even when kinetic energy is lost, momentum is still conserved if no net external force acts."
What distinguishes momentum from kinetic energy in collisions?,Only energy is a vector,"Energy is always conserved, momentum is not",Momentum is conserved even when energy is not,Momentum depends on heat,C,Momentum conservation depends on force interactions; energy can be transformed into other forms.
Two cars collide and stick together. Which quantity is definitely conserved?,Kinetic energy,Momentum,Potential energy,Force,B,"In all collisions without external forces, momentum is conserved—even if kinetic energy is lost."
"A student says: 'Kinetic energy is conserved, so momentum must be.' What’s the fix?",Only momentum determines motion,Energy conservation implies no force,Momentum can be conserved even when energy is not,Only mass matters in energy,C,Momentum and energy are conserved independently. One doesn’t imply the other.
"In which type of collision is kinetic energy NOT conserved, but momentum is?",Elastic,Inelastic,Gravitational,Projectile,B,"Inelastic collisions conserve momentum but lose kinetic energy to deformation, sound, etc."
What condition ensures that momentum will be conserved in a collision?,Kinetic energy is constant,Heat is not produced,No net external force acts on the system,Mass is equal,C,External forces can change momentum. Energy losses do not necessarily affect momentum conservation.
"Two 2 kg carts stick together after a collision. One was moving at 3 m/s, the other at rest. Final velocity?",1.5 m/s,3 m/s,2 m/s,0 m/s,A,Initial p = 6; final mass = 4 kg → v = 6 ÷ 4 = 1.5 m/s
A 5 kg object moves at 2 m/s and sticks to a 5 kg object at rest. How much KE is lost?,0 J,5 J,10 J,25 J,D,Initial KE = ½·5·(2)² = 10 J; final v = 1 m/s → KE = ½·10·1² = 5 J; loss = 10 – 5 = 5 J
A 4 kg object at 3 m/s collides with a 2 kg object at rest. Final v if they stick?,1 m/s,2 m/s,3 m/s,6 m/s,B,Initial p = 12; total mass = 6 → v = 12 ÷ 6 = 2 m/s
