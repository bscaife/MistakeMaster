Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What determines the total momentum of a system?,Only the object with the largest mass,Only the fastest object,The vector sum of all individual momenta (m·v),The net external force,C,"System momentum is the sum of each object’s m·v, not just the largest mass."
Why is it incorrect to say the biggest object always determines momentum?,Because mass doesn’t matter,Because small masses moving fast contribute too,Because only collisions matter,Because the largest object never moves,B,Momentum depends on both mass and velocity. A small object with high speed may contribute significantly.
"Two carts move right: one 5 kg at 1 m/s, one 1 kg at 5 m/s. Which contributes more momentum?",They contribute equally,The large cart,The small cart,"Neither, since direction is the same",A,"5×1 = 5 kg·m/s, 1×5 = 5 kg·m/s. Same momentum despite different mass and speed."
Which object affects total momentum the least?,A large mass at rest,A small fast object,An object moving slowly,An object moving opposite direction,A,An object at rest has zero velocity → zero momentum contribution regardless of mass.
How should system momentum be calculated?,By using the largest object only,By averaging the masses,By summing all m·v values with direction,By finding the heaviest object’s speed,C,Each object’s momentum matters. Momentum is a vector and must be summed with signs.
A student ignores a small object in momentum calculation. When is this valid?,Only when it’s at rest,If it’s not in contact with the ground,If its mass is over 100 kg,If it’s moving at constant velocity,A,Only objects with nonzero velocity contribute to momentum.
What mistake leads students to focus only on large objects?,Confusing momentum with weight,Ignoring mass altogether,Assuming velocity is always zero,Adding speeds directly,A,"Students sometimes equate mass or weight with dominant momentum, ignoring the velocity term."
A 10 kg object at 1 m/s and 2 kg object at 4 m/s both move right. Total momentum?,14 kg·m/s,18 kg·m/s,20 kg·m/s,12 kg·m/s,B,10×1 + 2×4 = 10 + 8 = 18 kg·m/s.
A 6 kg object at rest and a 1 kg object at 6 m/s. System momentum?,0 kg·m/s,6 kg·m/s,36 kg·m/s,12 kg·m/s,B,6 kg at rest adds 0. Small object: 1×6 = 6 kg·m/s total.
A 3 kg cart at 2 m/s and a 5 kg cart at –1 m/s. Total momentum?,1 kg·m/s,–1 kg·m/s,11 kg·m/s,0 kg·m/s,A,3×2 = 6; 5×(–1) = –5 → 6 – 5 = 1 kg·m/s.
