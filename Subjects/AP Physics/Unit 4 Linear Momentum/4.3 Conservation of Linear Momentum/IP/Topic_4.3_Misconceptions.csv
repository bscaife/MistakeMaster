Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH148,Momentum is only conserved when velocity is constant,"Mistakes momentum conservation for constant motion, not recognizing it depends on the absence of net external force."
PH149,Momentum of the system equals the sum of speeds,"Adds scalar speeds rather than vector momenta, ignoring both mass and direction in system momentum calculations."
PH150,Momentum is not conserved if objects move in different directions,Fails to account for vector nature of momentum and its conservation in multiple dimensions.
PH151,Momentum is always zero before and after explosion,"Thinks internal explosions must cancel all motion, forgetting total momentum is conserved and may be nonzero."
PH152,Momentum conservation requires equal mass,Mistakenly believes systems must contain equal-mass objects for momentum to be conserved.
PH153,System momentum equals momentum of the largest object,"Assumes dominant objects determine total system momentum, ignoring contributions from all masses."
PH154,Momentum conservation requires energy conservation,Fails to distinguish that momentum is conserved even in inelastic collisions where kinetic energy is lost.
