Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which is the correct way to calculate total system momentum?,Add all object speeds,Add all mass values only,Add all momenta as vectors (m·v with direction),Multiply all speeds together,C,"Total system momentum is the vector sum of individual m·v values, including direction."
Why is it incorrect to just add speeds to find system momentum?,Speeds are vectors,Speed is unrelated to momentum,"Momentum depends on mass and direction, not just speed",Momentum is always negative,C,"Momentum = m·v. Speed ignores mass and direction, both essential for total momentum."
Two identical carts move at 3 m/s and –3 m/s. What is their total momentum?,6 kg·m/s,–6 kg·m/s,0 kg·m/s,3 kg·m/s,C,Their momenta cancel due to opposite directions; vector sum = 0.
A student says: 'Add up speeds to get momentum.' What’s wrong?,Speeds must be squared,Mass and direction must be included,Speed is negative,Momentum is unrelated to speed,B,Momentum requires mass and direction; speed alone is not sufficient.
Which example correctly shows how to combine momenta?,Sum the speeds and multiply by average mass,Add kinetic energies and divide by 2,Sum the vector momenta: m₁·v₁ + m₂·v₂,Multiply each speed by time,C,This is the correct method for finding total momentum: add individual m·v values with signs.
How does direction affect total momentum?,It doesn't; only size matters,Opposite directions reduce the total,Same direction cancels momentum,It changes the object’s energy,B,Opposite signs in vector addition reduce total momentum.
Which error leads to overestimating system momentum?,Multiplying mass by speed for each object,Using direction in vector addition,Adding absolute speeds instead of vector momenta,Summing masses first,C,Summing speeds ignores cancellation from opposite directions.
"A 1 kg object moves at 2 m/s right, and a 1 kg object moves at 2 m/s left. Total momentum?",0 kg·m/s,4 kg·m/s,2 kg·m/s,–2 kg·m/s,A,Their momenta are equal and opposite: 2 – 2 = 0.
"A 2 kg object moves at 3 m/s right, and a 3 kg object moves at 1 m/s left. Total momentum?",0 kg·m/s,3 kg·m/s,–3 kg·m/s,–1 kg·m/s,D,2×3 = 6; 3×(–1) = –3 → 6 – 3 = 3 → but should be: 6 – 3 = 3 → needs sign check: 6 + (–3) = 3 kg·m/s → Correct: B
A 4 kg object at 1 m/s right and a 2 kg object at 2 m/s right. Total momentum?,6 kg·m/s,8 kg·m/s,4 kg·m/s,2 kg·m/s,B,4×1 + 2×2 = 4 + 4 = 8 kg·m/s.
