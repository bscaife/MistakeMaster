Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH134,Momentum and force are the same thing,"Confuses momentum (𝑝 = 𝑚·𝑣) with force (𝐹 = 𝑚·𝑎), assuming both represent “push” or “impact.”"
PH135,Only moving objects have momentum,"Believes momentum is tied to motion being visible, ignoring that velocity is needed but may be subtle."
PH136,Momentum is not a vector,"Thinks momentum is a scalar quantity, ignoring directionality of velocity in 𝑝 = 𝑚·𝑣."
PH137,Mass determines momentum alone,Ignores velocity; assumes heavier things always have more momentum regardless of speed.
PH138,Momentum is always conserved,Doesn’t recognize that momentum conservation only applies in isolated systems without net external forces.
PH139,All objects in a system get equal momentum,"Assumes momentum is divided evenly regardless of mass differences (e.g., in explosions)."
PH140,Impulse and momentum are unrelated,Doesn’t understand that impulse (𝐹·𝑡) is the cause of a change in momentum (Δ𝑝 = 𝐽).
PH141,Impulse is a force,"Confuses impulse with force itself, rather than understanding it as force applied over a time interval."
PH142,Longer contact time always means greater force,"Fails to distinguish that impulse depends on the product of force and time, not time alone."
PH143,Impulse only occurs during collisions,"Thinks impulse applies only in collision events, missing that it occurs whenever a net force acts over time."
PH144,Impulse and momentum are unrelated,"Overlooks the impulse–momentum theorem, which directly connects impulse to change in momentum."
PH145,Impulse depends on path or distance,"Mistakes impulse for work, believing that the path length affects impulse."
PH146,Impulse can be measured from acceleration graphs,"Attempts to use a vs. t graphs instead of F vs. t graphs to calculate impulse, not recognizing proper graph-based representations."
PH147,Direction of impulse is arbitrary,Does not recognize that impulse has direction and must align with the direction of net force.
PH148,Momentum is only conserved when velocity is constant,"Mistakes momentum conservation for constant motion, not recognizing it depends on the absence of net external force."
PH149,Momentum of the system equals the sum of speeds,"Adds scalar speeds rather than vector momenta, ignoring both mass and direction in system momentum calculations."
PH150,Momentum is not conserved if objects move in different directions,Fails to account for vector nature of momentum and its conservation in multiple dimensions.
PH151,Momentum is always zero before and after explosion,"Thinks internal explosions must cancel all motion, forgetting total momentum is conserved and may be nonzero."
PH152,Momentum conservation requires equal mass,Mistakenly believes systems must contain equal-mass objects for momentum to be conserved.
PH153,System momentum equals momentum of the largest object,"Assumes dominant objects determine total system momentum, ignoring contributions from all masses."
PH154,Momentum conservation requires energy conservation,Fails to distinguish that momentum is conserved even in inelastic collisions where kinetic energy is lost.
PH155,Elastic collisions mean objects don’t touch,"Assumes that elastic collisions happen without contact, not realizing that elastic refers to energy conservation, not physical separation."
PH156,Kinetic energy is always conserved in a collision,"Fails to recognize that kinetic energy is only conserved in elastic collisions, not in inelastic or perfectly inelastic ones."
PH157,"If objects stick together, momentum is not conserved","Believes that momentum conservation only applies when objects bounce apart, not understanding it also holds for perfectly inelastic collisions."
PH158,Inelastic collisions break Newton’s third law,"Thinks that unequal outcomes in velocity imply unequal forces, ignoring that third law forces act equally during contact."
PH159,Sticking together means total energy is lost,"Confuses energy transformation with energy loss, not realizing that energy becomes thermal or sound, but isn’t destroyed."
PH160,Elastic means same final speeds as initial,"Assumes that in elastic collisions, each object keeps its speed, missing that direction and mass affect final velocities."
PH161,Kinetic energy is always shared equally,"Thinks all objects in a collision must end with equal kinetic energy, ignoring differences in mass and speed."
