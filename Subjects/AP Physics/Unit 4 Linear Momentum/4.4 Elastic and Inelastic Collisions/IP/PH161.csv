Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What determines how kinetic energy is distributed in a system?,The number of objects,The total momentum,Each object’s mass and speed,The direction of motion,C,Kinetic energy depends on both mass and velocity (KE = ½·m·v²).
Why don’t all objects end with equal KE in a collision?,Because energy is not conserved,Because only velocity matters,Because different masses and speeds result in different KE values,Because lighter objects lose all energy,C,KE = ½·m·v² → varies with both mass and velocity.
"A student claims: 'After any collision, energy is equally shared.' What’s the correction?",Kinetic energy is not always conserved,Objects keep their original speeds,"Kinetic energy is divided based on mass and speed, not equally",All energy becomes heat,C,Distribution of kinetic energy depends on individual motion and mass.
Two objects of different mass move at same speed. Which has more KE?,The smaller object,The one with higher direction,They have equal KE,The heavier object,D,KE = ½·m·v² → more mass = more kinetic energy at same speed.
Which factor causes unequal KE sharing even in elastic collisions?,Equal masses,Speed matching,Different mass and resulting speed outcomes,Total energy increase,C,"Elastic collisions can conserve total KE, but not divide it equally between objects."
What does equal KE imply?,Equal force,Equal mass and speed,Equal direction of motion,Equal temperature,B,"To have equal KE, objects must match in both mass and speed."
Why might a lighter object end up with more KE?,It stores mass,It reflects energy,It can move faster after collision,It compresses better,C,Higher speed can compensate for smaller mass and result in high KE.
A 2 kg object at 3 m/s and a 1 kg object at 3 m/s. Which has more KE?,Same KE,1 kg object,2 kg object,Neither has KE,C,KE = ½·m·v² → ½·2·9 = 9 J vs. ½·1·9 = 4.5 J → 2 kg object has more.
"Object A (1 kg, 4 m/s), Object B (2 kg, 2 m/s). Which has more KE?",A,B,Same,Neither,A,"KE A = 8 J, KE B = 4 J → A has more KE."
"Two objects collide. One ends with 6 J KE, other with 2 J. What does this show?",They shared KE equally,Heavier object kept more KE,KE is always lost,KE is not equally shared,D,KE isn’t automatically divided equally—it depends on mass and final speed.
