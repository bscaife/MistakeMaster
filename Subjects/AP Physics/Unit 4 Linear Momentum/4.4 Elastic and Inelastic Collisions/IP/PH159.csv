Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What happens to energy in a perfectly inelastic collision?,All energy disappears,Kinetic energy is converted to other forms,Energy is created,Momentum is lost,B,"While kinetic energy is not conserved, it transforms into heat, sound, or deformation."
A student says energy is lost if objects stick. What’s the correction?,Energy loss only applies to momentum,Sticking is only possible in elastic collisions,Energy transforms but total energy is conserved,Sticking doesn’t require force,C,Total energy is conserved. Kinetic energy changes form but is not destroyed.
Which kind of energy is not conserved in a sticky collision?,Thermal,Potential,Kinetic,Total,C,Kinetic energy is not conserved in inelastic collisions; some is transformed into other forms.
Which of the following is always conserved in collisions?,Kinetic energy,Thermal energy,Momentum,Speed,C,Momentum is conserved in all collisions as long as no net external force acts.
Why do inelastic collisions appear to 'lose' energy?,Mass decreases,Heat and sound are hard to see,Momentum is destroyed,Velocity stays the same,B,"Energy is transformed to forms like sound and thermal energy, which may not be obvious."
"If two objects stick together and move slower than before, what happened?",All momentum was lost,Energy was destroyed,Some kinetic energy became heat or sound,Time reversed,C,"Some of the system’s initial kinetic energy became other forms, but was not destroyed."
Which principle explains that energy is not truly lost?,Conservation of speed,Conservation of inertia,Conservation of energy,Newton’s third law,C,"Total energy is always conserved, even if kinetic energy decreases."
A 2 kg object at 2 m/s sticks to a 2 kg object at rest. Initial KE = ?,4 J,2 J,8 J,0 J,A,KE = ½·2·(2)² = 4 J
Final KE if 4 kg moves at 0.5 m/s after a sticky collision?,1 J,2 J,0.5 J,4 J,A,KE = ½·4·(0.5)² = 0.5 J
"If initial KE = 10 J and final KE = 6 J, how much energy transformed?",16 J,4 J,6 J,10 J,B,"10 – 6 = 4 J transformed into thermal, sound, etc."
