Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does Newton’s third law state?,F = m·a,An object in motion stays in motion,"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction",Energy is conserved,C,Newton's third law means two objects exert equal and opposite forces on each other during interaction.
Why doesn’t an inelastic collision violate Newton’s third law?,Because momentum isn’t conserved,Because kinetic energy is constant,Because the forces during collision are still equal and opposite,Because mass is equal,C,"Even in inelastic collisions, forces between objects are equal and opposite during contact."
Two objects stick together after a collision. What can be said about forces during contact?,Only the heavier object felt force,They exerted equal and opposite forces,No force acted at all,Only one object experienced acceleration,B,"According to Newton’s third law, both objects exert equal and opposite forces on each other."
Why do objects have different final velocities after collision if forces were equal?,They had different impulses,"They had different masses, so different accelerations",Only one object moved,Force was only on one side,B,Same force causes different accelerations if the masses are different: a = F/m.
A student says Newton’s third law is broken when objects don’t rebound symmetrically. What’s wrong?,Energy is always conserved,Forces can be unequal if speeds are different,Forces are still equal and opposite regardless of final velocities,Mass cancels all forces,C,Third law forces act during contact and are equal and opposite regardless of the outcome.
Which condition does Newton’s third law apply to?,Only elastic collisions,Only when objects have the same speed,Any time two objects interact,Only when one object is much larger,C,"Newton’s third law always applies to interactions, including all collisions."
Which force pair is an example of Newton’s third law?,Weight and friction,Push on a wall and wall pushing back,Force and velocity,Mass and inertia,B,This is a classic third law pair: equal and opposite forces during interaction.
A 1 kg cart collides with a 2 kg cart. What can be said about the force each feels?,1 kg cart feels twice the force,Both feel the same force,Only the lighter cart is affected,Only the larger cart exerts force,B,Newton’s third law guarantees both experience equal and opposite forces during contact.
A 3 kg object and a 1 kg object collide and stick. Which one experienced greater acceleration?,The 3 kg object,They accelerate equally,The 1 kg object,Neither object accelerates,C,Same force → a = F/m → smaller mass experiences larger acceleration.
"If force = 6 N and mass = 2 kg, what is the acceleration during contact?",3 m/s²,12 m/s²,1 m/s²,4 m/s²,A,a = F/m = 6 ÷ 2 = 3 m/s².
