Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What defines an elastic collision?,Objects keep their original speeds,Objects do not interact,Total kinetic energy and momentum are conserved,Objects stick together,C,Elastic collisions conserve both kinetic energy and momentum—not necessarily individual speeds.
Why might two objects have different final speeds after an elastic collision?,Because energy was lost,Because of friction,Because mass and direction affect the outcome,Because force was unequal,C,"Even in elastic collisions, different masses and directions lead to different final speeds."
A student says objects in elastic collisions keep the same speed. What’s the fix?,They reverse direction instead,Only the heavier object changes speed,Final speed depends on both mass and velocity of each object,Elastic collisions do not occur in physics,C,"Speed changes based on conservation of momentum and energy, not just type of collision."
Which is conserved in elastic collisions?,Only direction,Momentum and kinetic energy,Velocity of each object,Speed only,B,Elastic collisions conserve both total kinetic energy and total momentum.
Why don’t both objects keep their original speed in elastic collisions?,Energy isn’t conserved,Impulse is reversed,"The masses may differ, and energy is redistributed",Forces cancel out speed,C,Energy is transferred based on both mass and velocity—not simply retained.
Which condition must hold true for a collision to be elastic?,The objects do not touch,The final speeds match initial speeds exactly,Total kinetic energy is the same before and after,Only one object moves,C,Kinetic energy conservation is the key feature of elastic collisions.
How can objects rebound with different speeds in an elastic collision?,Only if one object is lighter,Because velocity and momentum are exchanged differently based on mass,Because force cancels energy,Because elastic means no acceleration,B,The outcome depends on both mass and initial velocity distributions.
"Two equal-mass carts collide elastically. One moves at 2 m/s, the other is at rest. After collision?","First stops, second moves at 2 m/s",Both move at 1 m/s,"First reverses, second stays still",Both stop,A,"In equal-mass elastic collisions, the moving object transfers its velocity to the other."
"In a head-on elastic collision, 2 kg at 3 m/s hits 2 kg at –3 m/s. What are final velocities?",They both stop,They reverse speeds,Only one changes,They stick together,B,"In equal-mass elastic collisions with equal and opposite speeds, they swap velocities."
A 3 kg cart at 2 m/s hits a 1 kg cart at rest. Elastic collision. Final speed of 1 kg cart?,2 m/s,3 m/s,1.5 m/s,3.5 m/s,B,Use elastic collision velocity formulas or conservation laws. Lighter cart exits faster than heavier incoming.
