Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
In which type of collision is kinetic energy conserved?,Inelastic,Elastic,Explosive,Gravitational,B,Only elastic collisions conserve both momentum and kinetic energy.
Why is it incorrect to say kinetic energy is always conserved?,Because mass changes,Because kinetic energy can transform into heat or deformation,Because velocity is not real,Because force is always external,B,"In inelastic collisions, some kinetic energy is converted into other forms such as sound or heat."
"Which quantity is always conserved in collisions, regardless of energy changes?",Kinetic energy,Impulse,Momentum,Force,C,Momentum is conserved in both elastic and inelastic collisions when no net external force is present.
Which collision type results in loss of kinetic energy?,Elastic,Inelastic,Isolated,Gravitational,B,"In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is not conserved—it may become thermal or sound energy."
What is the defining feature of a perfectly inelastic collision?,Energy is conserved,Kinetic energy increases,Objects stick together and kinetic energy is lost,Momentum is destroyed,C,"In perfectly inelastic collisions, objects stick together, and kinetic energy is not conserved."
Why might a student believe kinetic energy is always conserved?,They confuse it with total energy,They ignore energy loss to sound,They measure motion incorrectly,They use mass instead of energy,A,"Total energy is conserved, but mechanical (kinetic) energy is not always conserved in collisions."
What happens to total kinetic energy in a perfectly inelastic collision?,It increases,It is conserved,It is partially transformed into other forms,It is irrelevant,C,"Some of the kinetic energy becomes heat, deformation, or sound."
"Two 1 kg objects collide elastically. One moves at 2 m/s, the other at rest. Final KE total?",2 J,1 J,0 J,2 J (unchanged),D,Elastic collision = KE is conserved → KE before = KE after = ½·1·(2)² = 2 J.
A 3 kg object moving at 2 m/s sticks to a 2 kg object at rest. Final KE?,3.6 J,4.8 J,2.4 J,6.0 J,A,Initial KE = ½·3·4 = 6 J. Final v = (6/5) = 1.2 m/s → KE = ½·5·(1.2)² = 3.6 J
"In a collision, initial KE = 10 J, final KE = 7 J. What happened?",Kinetic energy was not conserved,Momentum was lost,Mass changed,Velocity increased,A,Loss of KE = sign of inelastic collision; momentum may still be conserved.
