Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does the term 'elastic collision' mean?,Objects bounce without touching,No force is involved,Kinetic energy and momentum are both conserved,Only energy is lost,C,An elastic collision conserves both momentum and kinetic energy. Contact still occurs.
Why do elastic collisions involve contact?,All forces require long-range interaction,Contact is how forces are exchanged to change momentum,Only gravity applies without contact,Objects can never touch in real collisions,B,"Elastic collisions involve direct force exchange, requiring brief contact to change momentum."
A student says elastic collisions don’t involve touching. What’s the fix?,Touching causes inelasticity,Only touching produces impulse,"Elastic refers to energy conservation, not contact",Elastic collisions don’t require mass,C,Elastic collisions conserve kinetic energy and momentum. Contact is still required to exchange force.
Which condition must be true in an elastic collision?,No net force,Perfect energy loss,Kinetic energy remains constant,Mass must be equal,C,"In elastic collisions, total kinetic energy before and after is unchanged."
How do two billiard balls interact in an elastic collision?,They exert forces without touching,They bounce due to contact forces and conserve energy,They roll forever without force,They combine into one object,B,Elastic collisions involve actual contact where energy and momentum are conserved.
Which graph would confirm an elastic collision?,Velocity vs. time showing loss,Kinetic energy constant before and after,Net impulse = 0,Force vs. time with constant slope,B,Conserved kinetic energy is the defining feature of an elastic collision.
Why do atoms in gases undergo elastic collisions?,They never touch,Their speeds always increase,They briefly contact and rebound with conserved KE,They stick together and accelerate,C,Atomic collisions involve brief contact where KE is conserved—making them elastic.
"Two 1 kg carts collide elastically. One moves at 2 m/s, the other is at rest. Final speed of first?",0 m/s,2 m/s,1 m/s,4 m/s,A,"In equal-mass elastic collisions, moving object transfers all momentum to the stationary one."
A 2 kg object at 3 m/s collides elastically with a 1 kg object at rest. Speed of 1 kg object after?,2 m/s,3 m/s,4 m/s,5 m/s,C,Apply conservation of momentum and kinetic energy (or use known formula for 1D elastic collisions).
Two objects collide elastically. Total KE before = 10 J. What is total KE after?,0 J,5 J,10 J,20 J,C,Elastic collision = total kinetic energy conserved.
