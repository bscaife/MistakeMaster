Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
In which type of collision do objects stick together?,Elastic,Perfectly inelastic,Explosive,Frictionless,B,"In perfectly inelastic collisions, objects stick together after impact but momentum is still conserved."
A student says momentum isn’t conserved if objects stick together. What’s the correction?,That’s only true in elastic collisions,Momentum is always conserved in closed systems regardless of sticking,Sticking cancels out energy and force,Only speed is conserved in collisions,B,Momentum conservation doesn’t depend on sticking—only on the absence of net external force.
Which statement is true about a perfectly inelastic collision?,Momentum is not conserved,Kinetic energy is conserved,"Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not",Objects bounce off with equal speed,C,"Momentum is conserved in all collisions with no net external force, but kinetic energy is lost in inelastic ones."
What quantity remains constant in all types of collisions if no external forces act?,Velocity,Kinetic energy,Momentum,Mass,C,"Momentum is always conserved in isolated systems, regardless of the collision type."
Which of the following results from a perfectly inelastic collision?,Energy increases,Objects stick together and move with shared velocity,Momentum is destroyed,Objects pass through each other,B,Sticking together is the defining trait of a perfectly inelastic collision.
A student calculates momentum before and after a sticky collision and finds it matches. What does this show?,Kinetic energy is conserved,Momentum is conserved even if objects stick together,Mass has changed,The system isn’t closed,B,Sticking together doesn’t prevent momentum conservation.
Which of these best proves momentum is conserved when objects stick?,Equal speeds after collision,Smaller total mass after,"Total p before = total p after, even though KE changes",Total energy is higher,C,Momentum conservation is independent of whether objects bounce or stick.
A 2 kg object at 3 m/s collides and sticks to a 1 kg object at rest. Final velocity?,1 m/s,2 m/s,3 m/s,0 m/s,B,"Total p = 6 kg·m/s, total mass = 3 kg → v = 6 / 3 = 2 m/s."
A 5 kg cart moving at 2 m/s sticks to a 5 kg cart at rest. Final velocity?,1 m/s,2 m/s,2.5 m/s,0 m/s,A,"Total p = 10 kg·m/s, total mass = 10 kg → v = 10 / 10 = 1 m/s."
"Two carts stick together after collision. One was 2 kg at 4 m/s, other was 2 kg at –2 m/s. Final velocity?",1 m/s,0 m/s,2 m/s,–1 m/s,B,Total p = 8 – 4 = 0 kg·m/s → total mass = 4 kg → v = 0 / 4 = 0 m/s.
