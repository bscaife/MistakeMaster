Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH155,Elastic collisions mean objects don’t touch,"Assumes that elastic collisions happen without contact, not realizing that elastic refers to energy conservation, not physical separation."
PH156,Kinetic energy is always conserved in a collision,"Fails to recognize that kinetic energy is only conserved in elastic collisions, not in inelastic or perfectly inelastic ones."
PH157,"If objects stick together, momentum is not conserved","Believes that momentum conservation only applies when objects bounce apart, not understanding it also holds for perfectly inelastic collisions."
PH158,Inelastic collisions break Newton’s third law,"Thinks that unequal outcomes in velocity imply unequal forces, ignoring that third law forces act equally during contact."
PH159,Sticking together means total energy is lost,"Confuses energy transformation with energy loss, not realizing that energy becomes thermal or sound, but isn’t destroyed."
PH160,Elastic means same final speeds as initial,"Assumes that in elastic collisions, each object keeps its speed, missing that direction and mass affect final velocities."
PH161,Kinetic energy is always shared equally,"Thinks all objects in a collision must end with equal kinetic energy, ignoring differences in mass and speed."
