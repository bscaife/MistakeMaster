Which collision type conserves both momentum and kinetic energy?,C,Perfectly inelastic,FALSE,PH156,Partially elastic,FALSE,PH156,Elastic,TRUE,,Explosive,FALSE,PH157,Only elastic collisions conserve both KE and momentum.
Two carts collide and stick together. What must be true?,A,Momentum is conserved— but kinetic energy is not.,TRUE,,Both momentum and energy are conserved.,FALSE,PH156,Velocity is conserved.,FALSE,PH155,The final speed equals the initial speed.,FALSE,PH157,In perfectly inelastic collisions— momentum conserved— KE is not.
A moving object hits a stationary object of equal mass elastically. What happens?,B,Both objects stop.,FALSE,PH156,The moving object stops— and the second moves with its speed.,TRUE,,Both move in same direction together.,FALSE,PH157,They rebound with reversed speeds.,FALSE,PH156,In 1D elastic collisions of equal mass— momentum and KE swap.
Which quantity is always conserved in all collisions?,C,Kinetic energy,FALSE,PH156,Velocity,FALSE,PH157,Momentum,TRUE,,Mass × speed,FALSE,PH155,Momentum is always conserved unless external force acts.
A 2 kg cart moving at 4 m/s collides and rebounds elastically. What is change in momentum?,A,∆p = −16 kg·m/s,TRUE,,∆p = 0,FALSE,PH160,∆p = 8,FALSE,PH160,∆p = 4,FALSE,PH160,Velocity reverses → ∆p = m·(−v − v) = −2mv
Which is NOT true about inelastic collisions?,D,Objects may stick together.,FALSE,,Momentum is conserved.,FALSE,,Some KE converts to other forms.,FALSE,,Kinetic energy increases.,TRUE,PH156,In inelastic collisions— KE is lost — not gained.
Two carts of mass m and 2m collide elastically. First at v— second at rest. What is final velocity of first?,B,v,FALSE,PH156,vff = (m − 2m)v / (m + 2m) = −v / 3,TRUE,,0,FALSE,PH160,2v,FALSE,PH155,Use elastic collision formula: v₁f = (m₁−m₂)v₁ / (m₁+m₂)
Why is KE not conserved in a perfectly inelastic collision?,C,Momentum is lost.,FALSE,PH156,Forces are unequal.,FALSE,PH158,Some energy converts to thermal— sound— etc.,TRUE,,Velocity is zero.,FALSE,PH159,Energy conserved overall— but not all stays in KE form.
A system explodes into pieces. What is true about total momentum?,A,It is conserved if no external forces act.,TRUE,,It becomes infinite.,FALSE,PH153,It equals total energy.,FALSE,PH159,It reverses direction.,FALSE,PH153,Even in explosions— momentum conserved if isolated system.
Two unequal masses collide inelastically and stick. What is the final speed?,D,v = √(v₁v₂),FALSE,PH156,v = (m₁ + m₂) / (v₁ + v₂),FALSE,PH155,v = (v₁ − v₂) / (m₁ + m₂),FALSE,PH155,vf = (m₁v₁ + m₂v₂) / (m₁ + m₂),TRUE,,Total p = (m₁ + m₂)·v → solve for v
