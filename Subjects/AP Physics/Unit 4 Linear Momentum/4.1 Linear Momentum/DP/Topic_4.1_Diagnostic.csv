Question,Correct Answer,Choice A,Correct? A,Code A,Choice B,Correct? B,Code B,Choice C,Correct? C,Code C,Choice D,Correct? D,Code D,Explanation
Which expression defines linear momentum?,A,p = m · v,TRUE,,p = m / v,FALSE,PH134,p = v² / m,FALSE,PH134,p = m + v,FALSE,PH134,Momentum is the product of mass and velocity: p = m · v
If mass doubles while velocity remains constant— what happens to momentum?,D,It stays the same.,FALSE,PH138,It halves.,FALSE,PH138,It quadruples.,FALSE,PH138,It doubles.,TRUE,,p = m · v → double mass = double momentum
A 5 kg object moving at 4 m/s collides with a 3 kg object at rest. What is total momentum before collision?,C,12 kg·m/s,FALSE,PH140,35 kg·m/s,FALSE,PH140,20 kg·m/s,TRUE,,0 kg·m/s,FALSE,PH139,Only the 5 kg object has initial momentum: 5·4 = 20 kg·m/s
Which principle applies during a collision when no external force acts?,B,Momentum equals mass.,FALSE,PH134,Momentum of the system is conserved.,TRUE,,Kinetic energy is always conserved.,FALSE,PH140,Acceleration is zero.,FALSE,PH139,Momentum conservation holds in isolated systems.
A system’s total momentum is zero. What must be true?,A,All momenta cancel out in vector sum.,TRUE,,Each object must be at rest.,FALSE,PH139,No object has any velocity.,FALSE,PH139,The masses are all equal.,FALSE,PH138,Momentum is vector — total can be zero if parts cancel.
Two equal-mass objects move toward each other at speed v. What is total momentum?,B,2m · v,FALSE,PH137,0,TRUE,,m · v,FALSE,PH137,−m · v,FALSE,PH139,Their momenta are equal and opposite → p_total = 0
A 2 kg object at 3 m/s collides and sticks to a 4 kg object at 1 m/s. What is final speed?,B,1 m/s,FALSE,PH140,1.67 m/s,TRUE,,3 m/s,FALSE,PH138,Cannot determine.,FALSE,PH139,Use conservation: p_initial = p_final → solve for v
A cart of mass m bounces off a wall. Speed is same before and after. What happens to momentum?,D,It doubles.,FALSE,PH136,It vanishes.,FALSE,PH137,It is conserved for the wall.,FALSE,PH134,It changes direction— so vector momentum changes.,TRUE,,Momentum is vector → sign reversal means ∆p = 2mv
Which describes momentum in an explosion?,C,Total momentum becomes positive.,FALSE,PH140,Larger pieces gain more momentum.,FALSE,PH138,Total momentum is conserved even as objects fly apart.,TRUE,,Momentum is destroyed by the explosion.,FALSE,PH136,Internal forces change individual momenta but system total stays the same.
What is the best explanation for momentum conservation?,A,No net external force acts on the system.,TRUE,,Objects must have equal mass.,FALSE,PH138,Velocities must cancel.,FALSE,PH139,Force and energy are balanced.,FALSE,PH134,Conservation requires ∑Fₑₓₜ = 0 — internal changes don’t affect system p
