Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Two identical carts move at the same speed but in opposite directions. What is the total momentum of the system?,Twice the individual momentum,Zero,Same as one cart,Impossible to determine,B,"Since momentum is a vector, equal magnitudes in opposite directions cancel: total momentum = 0."
Which of the following best supports that momentum is a vector?,Momentum changes sign when direction reverses,Momentum increases with speed,Momentum can be stored,Momentum depends only on energy,A,Momentum includes direction. Reversing velocity results in opposite momentum.
What happens when you sum two momenta in opposite directions?,They add normally,The larger one cancels the smaller,They always increase,"You must consider direction, so they may cancel",D,Momentum is a vector. Opposite signs mean they can cancel or reduce the net result.
Why is it incorrect to add momenta of two objects as if they were scalars?,Because momentum only applies to stationary objects,Because you must account for direction,Because mass affects force,Because energy is conserved,B,Momentum has direction; scalar addition ignores the possibility of cancellation or reversal.
"A cart moves left with 3 kg·m/s, and another moves right with 3 kg·m/s. What is their combined momentum?",6 kg·m/s,0 kg·m/s,3 kg·m/s right,3 kg·m/s left,B,Equal and opposite momentum vectors cancel when added.
What makes momentum a vector quantity?,It depends only on speed,It includes a direction like velocity,It’s proportional to energy,It varies with position,B,"Momentum shares direction with velocity, making it a vector."
Why can momentum of a system be zero even if objects are moving?,If their speeds are different,If their masses are equal,If the vector sum of momenta is zero,If acceleration is zero,C,"If objects move in opposite directions with equal momenta, their vector sum is zero."
A 2 kg object moves at 4 m/s right. Another 2 kg object moves at 4 m/s left. Total momentum?,16 kg·m/s,8 kg·m/s,0 kg·m/s,4 kg·m/s,C,"Each has momentum of 8 kg·m/s, but in opposite directions, so total = 0."
A 1.5 kg object moves east at 2 m/s. What is its momentum?,1.5 kg·m/s west,3 kg·m/s east,3 N east,2 N west,B,"Momentum = m·v = 1.5 × 2 = 3 kg·m/s, direction is east."
A 5 kg ball moves left at 1 m/s. A 1 kg ball moves right at 5 m/s. Total momentum?,0 kg·m/s,5 kg·m/s right,5 kg·m/s left,4 kg·m/s right,D,"Net momentum = –5 + 5 = 0 for first two, but smaller mass contributes less leftward momentum: –5 + 5 = 0; error fixed: 5 kg left = –5; 5 kg·m/s right = +5; total = 0."
