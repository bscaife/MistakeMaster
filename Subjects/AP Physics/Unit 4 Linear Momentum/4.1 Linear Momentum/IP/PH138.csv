Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
When is momentum conserved in a system?,Only when energy is also conserved,When the system is isolated from external forces,"Always, regardless of forces",Only in collisions with equal masses,B,Momentum is only conserved in an isolated system with no net external forces.
Why is momentum not conserved when friction is present?,Friction increases mass,Friction prevents motion,Friction is an external force acting on the system,Friction adds energy to the system,C,"Friction is an external force, and external forces disrupt momentum conservation."
A student claims momentum is always conserved. What is a counterexample?,Two ice skaters push apart on frictionless ice,A rocket in deep space ejects fuel,A car crashes into a wall and stops,Two carts collide on an air track,C,"The wall exerts an external force on the car, so momentum is not conserved for the car alone."
What condition is required to apply momentum conservation equations?,The system must be gaining speed,The system must have equal masses,No net external force acts on the system,Kinetic energy is constant,C,Momentum conservation applies when no net external force acts on the system.
Why can momentum be conserved in an explosion?,Explosions increase internal energy,The system includes all parts before and after,Each object loses mass,Force is zero in explosions,B,"If the system includes all fragments and no external force acts, momentum is conserved."
What does a net external force do to the momentum of a system?,It reverses it,It creates friction,It changes the momentum,It turns momentum into energy,C,A net external force causes momentum to increase or decrease.
Which situation violates the conditions needed for momentum conservation?,Two equal-mass objects rebound off each other in space,A person jumps off a floating boat,A cart slows down due to friction,Two blocks stick together after collision on a frictionless track,C,"Friction is an external force, so the momentum of the cart alone is not conserved."
"A 3 kg object moving at 4 m/s collides with a 1 kg object at rest. If they stick, what is final velocity?",1 m/s,2 m/s,3 m/s,4 m/s,C,Initial p = 3×4 = 12 kg·m/s. Total mass = 4 kg → v = 12/4 = 3 m/s.
A 5 kg cart moving at 2 m/s hits and sticks to a 3 kg stationary cart. Find the final velocity.,1.0 m/s,1.25 m/s,2.0 m/s,0.75 m/s,B,Initial momentum = 10 kg·m/s. Combined mass = 8 kg → v = 10/8 = 1.25 m/s.
A 2 kg object moving right at 6 m/s and a 4 kg object moving left at 3 m/s collide and stick. Final velocity?,0 m/s,1 m/s right,1 m/s left,3 m/s left,A,Total momentum = 12 - 12 = 0 → total mass = 6 kg → v = 0 m/s.
