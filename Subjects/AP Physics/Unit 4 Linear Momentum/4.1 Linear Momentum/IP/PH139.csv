Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"In an explosion, why don’t all objects get equal momentum?",Momentum is not conserved in explosions,Mass doesn’t affect momentum,Heavier objects get more momentum to conserve total system momentum,Energy replaces momentum during explosions,C,"To conserve momentum, objects with different mass have different velocities. Equal momentum is not required."
Which of the following statements is true about momentum in a two-object system?,Both objects must have the same momentum,Larger mass means slower speed to balance total momentum,Momentum is only shared if the objects are identical,Momentum divides evenly if energy is conserved,B,"If total momentum is conserved, momentum is not split evenly—larger mass often moves slower."
A small and a large object explode apart. What determines how much momentum each gets?,Their speed only,Their mass and speed together,Their shape,The duration of the explosion,B,"Momentum = m·v, so both mass and velocity determine how momentum is divided."
Why is it incorrect to assume all objects in an explosion fly apart with equal momentum?,Because energy is destroyed,Because only velocity matters,Because mass differences affect how momentum is distributed,Because explosions create new forces,C,Different masses will result in different velocities if total momentum is to be conserved.
Two fragments separate after a collision. One is much more massive. What is true?,They both move at the same speed,The lighter object gets more velocity,The heavier object gets more velocity,They have equal momentum,B,"To conserve momentum, a small mass must move faster than a large mass in the opposite direction."
Which quantity must be equal and opposite in an isolated two-object explosion?,Momentum of each object,Velocity of each object,Force on each object,Mass of each object,A,Each object’s momentum is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve total momentum.
Why might a student incorrectly believe momentum divides equally in collisions?,They confuse mass with force,They think all motion is symmetrical,They overlook the role of mass in determining momentum,They are using energy equations,C,Momentum division depends on mass and velocity. Equal momentum does not mean equal conditions.
A 1 kg object moves at 6 m/s right. A 2 kg object moves left to balance the momentum. What speed?,3 m/s,6 m/s,2 m/s,12 m/s,C,Total p must be zero: (1)(6) + (2)(v) = 0 → 6 + 2v = 0 → v = -3 m/s (3 m/s left)
"A 5 kg and a 1 kg object move apart after explosion. If the 5 kg moves at 2 m/s, how fast is the 1 kg?",2 m/s,10 m/s,5 m/s,1 m/s,B,To conserve momentum: 5×2 = 10 → 1×v = 10 → v = 10 m/s
Two blocks explode apart. One has 3 times the mass of the other. Which statement is true?,They move with equal speed,The lighter one has greater velocity,They both gain equal momentum,Momentum depends only on energy,B,"To conserve momentum, the smaller mass moves faster in the opposite direction."
