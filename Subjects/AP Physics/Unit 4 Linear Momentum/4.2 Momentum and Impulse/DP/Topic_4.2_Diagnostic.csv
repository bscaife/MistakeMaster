Which expression defines impulse?,C,J = F / t,FALSE,PH141,J = m / v,FALSE,PH141,J = F · ∆t,TRUE,,J = ∆t / F,FALSE,PH141,Impulse is force applied over a time interval: J = F · ∆t
Impulse changes momentum. What is this principle called?,B,Work-energy theorem,FALSE,PH144,Impulse-momentum theorem,TRUE,,Law of inertia,FALSE,PH144,Kinematic equivalence,FALSE,PH144,J = ∆p is the impulse-momentum theorem
If a constant force acts over a time ∆t on mass m— what is final speed v from rest?,D,v = F · m,FALSE,PH141,v = m / F,FALSE,PH141,v = F / m,FALSE,PH141,v = F · ∆t / m,TRUE,,Impulse = F·∆t = ∆p = m·v → solve for v
What quantity equals the area under a force vs. time graph?,A,Impulse,TRUE,,Velocity,FALSE,PH146,Work,FALSE,PH146,Power,FALSE,PH146,Area under F–t graph = F·∆t = J
A 0.2 kg ball moving at 10 m/s hits a wall and rebounds at 8 m/s. What is impulse?,B,J = 2 N·s,FALSE,PH144,J = −3.6 N·s,TRUE,,J = 1.8 N·s,FALSE,PH144,J = 4 N·s,FALSE,PH144,Impulse is the total momentum change: J = m·∆v
Which change increases impulse the most?,D,Halving the mass.,FALSE,PH144,Shorter time interval.,FALSE,PH142,Smaller force.,FALSE,PH142,Increasing both force and duration.,TRUE,,J = F·∆t → increase F and ∆t = more impulse
A student claims longer collisions always produce larger impulse. What’s wrong?,C,They are correct in all cases.,FALSE,PH142,Time always increases velocity.,FALSE,PH144,Impulse also depends on force magnitude.,TRUE,,Impulse only applies when velocity is zero.,FALSE,PH144,J = F·∆t → if F is small— long time doesn’t guarantee large J
Which of these shows why airbags help in crashes?,B,They increase force on the body.,FALSE,PH142,They increase the time over which the momentum changes.,TRUE,,They reduce speed.,FALSE,PH144,They reverse direction instantly.,FALSE,PH145,Longer ∆t → smaller F for same impulse (same ∆p)
If impulse is fixed— how can force be reduced?,C,Increase velocity.,FALSE,PH144,Decrease mass.,FALSE,PH144,Increase time interval ∆t.,TRUE,,Increase kinetic energy.,FALSE,PH145,F = J / ∆t → for fixed J— larger ∆t → smaller F
What does negative impulse mean?,A,Force is opposite to velocity direction.,TRUE,,The object speeds up.,FALSE,PH144,Momentum is destroyed.,FALSE,PH145,There is no force.,FALSE,PH141,Negative J = negative ∆p = slowing down or direction reversal
