Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH141,Impulse is a force,"Confuses impulse with force itself, rather than understanding it as force applied over a time interval."
PH142,Longer contact time always means greater force,"Fails to distinguish that impulse depends on the product of force and time, not time alone."
PH143,Impulse only occurs during collisions,"Thinks impulse applies only in collision events, missing that it occurs whenever a net force acts over time."
PH144,Impulse and momentum are unrelated,"Overlooks the impulseâ€“momentum theorem, which directly connects impulse to change in momentum."
PH145,Impulse depends on path or distance,"Mistakes impulse for work, believing that the path length affects impulse."
PH146,Impulse can be measured from acceleration graphs,"Attempts to use a vs. t graphs instead of F vs. t graphs to calculate impulse, not recognizing proper graph-based representations."
PH147,Direction of impulse is arbitrary,Does not recognize that impulse has direction and must align with the direction of net force.
