Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which of the following best describes the direction of impulse?,It is always upward,It has no direction,It is the same as the net force direction,It is opposite to velocity,C,Impulse is a vector and its direction matches the direction of the net force.
What happens if the net force is applied to the left?,Impulse is rightward,Impulse is still upward,Impulse is leftward,Impulse has no direction,C,Impulse must align with the direction of the applied net force.
Why is it incorrect to say 'impulse direction doesn’t matter'?,Because momentum is a scalar,Because impulse changes energy,"Because impulse changes momentum, a vector",Because force is not real,C,Impulse is a vector quantity and determines the direction of the momentum change.
Which variable does NOT affect impulse direction?,The direction of net force,The object’s mass,The time over which the force is applied,The change in momentum direction,B,"Mass affects magnitude, not direction. Impulse direction follows the direction of net force."
What does a negative impulse indicate?,Impulse has no direction,The object is speeding up,The impulse acts in the negative direction (opposite to original motion),The mass is negative,C,Negative sign shows impulse direction is opposite to the positive reference direction.
A student claims impulse always pushes forward. What’s the correction?,"Impulse is a force, not a motion",Impulse direction depends on force direction,Impulse is constant in all frames,Impulse only depends on time,B,Impulse is directional—it aligns with the net force regardless of object motion.
Which graph feature reveals impulse direction?,The width of the bar,The area above the time axis only,Whether the force is above or below the time axis,The slope of the graph,C,"If force is negative, impulse (area) is also negative—direction matters."
A 10 N force acts to the left for 2 seconds. What is the impulse?,20 N·s to the right,5 N·s upward,20 N·s to the left,20 N·s with no direction,C,Impulse = F·t = 10×2 = 20 N·s in the direction of the force: left.
A 3 kg object speeds up from 4 m/s to 1 m/s leftward. What is Δp?,9 kg·m/s left,3 kg·m/s right,12 kg·m/s right,9 kg·m/s right,A,Δp = m·Δv = 3×(1 - 4) = 3×(-3) = -9 kg·m/s → left.
An object is stopped by a force acting to the right. What is the impulse direction?,Left,Right,Upward,None,B,Impulse direction matches the net force: rightward.
