Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH204,Rotational kinetic energy is the same as translational kinetic energy,Assumes there's no distinction between energy due to linear motion and that due to rotational motion.
PH205,Only rotating objects have kinetic energy,"Fails to recognize that even without linear motion, rotating systems have kinetic energy due to rotation."
PH206,Rotational kinetic energy depends on linear velocity,Confuses translational velocity with angular velocity when calculating rotational kinetic energy.
PH207,Rotational energy is directional like angular momentum,Mistakes scalar nature of energy for vector-like properties such as direction.
PH208,Center of mass must move for energy to exist,Overlooks that internal rotation can contribute to kinetic energy even if center of mass is stationary.
PH209,All rotating systems have the same energy if they spin at the same rate,Ignores role of moment of inertia; assumes spin rate alone determines energy.
PH210,Rotational kinetic energy doesn't contribute to total energy,Neglects to include rotational terms when calculating total mechanical energy of a system.
