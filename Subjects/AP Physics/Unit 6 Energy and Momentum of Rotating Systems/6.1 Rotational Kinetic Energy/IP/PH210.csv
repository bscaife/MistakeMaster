Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which of the following contributes to total mechanical energy?,Both translational and rotational kinetic energy,Only potential energy,Only translational motion,Only kinetic energy,A,Total mechanical energy includes both ½·m·v² and ½·I·ω² when rotation is involved.
What term is added to total energy when an object rolls?,Friction,Gravitational force,Rotational KE,Tension,C,Rotational kinetic energy (½·I·ω²) must be included when an object rotates.
A rolling object has what type of energy?,Both rotational and translational kinetic energy,Translational only,Potential only,Only rotational,A,"A rolling object has ½·m·v² and ½·I·ω², both contributing to mechanical energy."
Which formula shows total kinetic energy for a rolling object?,KE = ½·m·v²,KE = ½·m·v² + ½·I·ω²,KE = m·g·h,KE = ½·I·ω²,B,Total KE includes translational and rotational terms when rolling.
A student calculates KE = ½·m·v² for a rolling ball. What did they miss?,Rotational energy,Friction,Gravitational potential,Centripetal force,A,They forgot to include ½·I·ω² from the ball’s rotation.
What happens to total energy if you ignore rotation?,It equals potential energy,It’s more accurate,It’s incomplete,It doesn’t change,C,Ignoring rotational energy omits part of the energy — total mechanical energy is incomplete.
Which object has both rotational and translational KE?,A block sliding,A spinning top that’s fixed,A pendulum at rest,A rolling wheel,D,The rolling wheel has both ½·m·v² and ½·I·ω².
What contributes to a system's total mechanical energy?,Only forces,Kinetic and potential energy only,Friction and mass,"Rotational KE, translational KE, and potential energy",D,Total mechanical energy includes KE (both types) and PE: ½·m·v² + ½·I·ω² + m·g·h.
What’s the energy expression for a ball rolling down a hill?,m·g·h = ½·m·v²,m·g·h = ½·I·ω²,m·g·h = ½·m·v² + ½·I·ω²,m·g·h = 0,C,Gravitational PE is converted into both translational and rotational kinetic energy.
Why must rotational energy be included in rolling motion energy problems?,Because it affects speed,Because it contributes real energy,Because it changes friction,Because it affects weight,B,Rotational KE is part of the total — ignoring it would underestimate the system’s energy.
