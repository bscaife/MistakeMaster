Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Is rotational kinetic energy a scalar or a vector?,Scalar,It depends,Vector,It changes with rotation direction,A,Energy is always a scalar quantity — rotational kinetic energy has magnitude but no direction.
A student says rotational energy points with spin. What’s the fix?,That’s true,It reverses with ω,Energy has no direction,It’s just like momentum,C,Energy is a scalar — it does not point with or against angular velocity.
Which of the following is a scalar quantity?,Angular momentum,Torque,Rotational energy,Displacement,C,"Rotational kinetic energy, like all energy, is a scalar and has no direction."
What happens to rotational energy if an object spins in the opposite direction?,It becomes negative,It stays the same,It reverses,It becomes a vector,B,"Since energy is scalar, it depends on the magnitude of ω², not its direction."
What does ½·I·ω² represent?,Rotational energy,Rotational inertia,Angular velocity,Angular displacement,A,This is the formula for rotational kinetic energy — a scalar quantity.
Why is energy not considered directional?,Because it's invisible,Because it is time-based,Because it's a scalar with no direction,Because it’s always positive,C,Energy is a scalar — it doesn’t have components or directions like vectors do.
Which quantity is directional?,Rotational energy,Kinetic energy,Thermal energy,Angular momentum,D,"Angular momentum is a vector — it has direction, unlike energy which is scalar."
"What type of quantity is kinetic energy, whether translational or rotational?",Variable,Vector,Directional,Scalar,D,Kinetic energy is scalar in all cases — rotational or linear.
A disk spins clockwise. What’s the direction of its kinetic energy?,Clockwise,None — energy has no direction,Counterclockwise,It reverses if spin does,B,Kinetic energy has no direction — only angular momentum is directional.
Which formula shows scalar nature of rotational energy?,τ = I·α,KE = ½·I·ω²,F = m·a,L = I·ω,B,The equation KE = ½·I·ω² describes scalar energy — not a vector quantity.
