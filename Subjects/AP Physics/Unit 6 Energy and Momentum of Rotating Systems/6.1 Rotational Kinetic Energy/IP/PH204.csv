Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the correct expression for rotational kinetic energy?,½·m·v²,½·I·ω²,I·ω,m·g·h,B,"Rotational kinetic energy is given by ½·I·ω², similar to ½·m·v² for translational motion."
How does rotational kinetic energy differ from translational kinetic energy?,They’re the same,Only mass matters,Rotational KE uses angular speed and moment of inertia,They use the same formula,C,"Rotational KE depends on rotational inertia (I) and angular speed (ω), unlike translational KE which depends on m and v."
Which of the following is true about kinetic energy in rotating objects?,It uses ω instead of v,It comes only from linear motion,It equals potential energy,It depends only on radius,A,"In rotational systems, angular velocity (ω) is used instead of linear velocity (v)."
A rolling object has what kind of kinetic energy?,Both translational and rotational,Rotational only,Translational only,Neither,A,A rolling object has both translational kinetic energy (½·m·v²) and rotational kinetic energy (½·I·ω²).
Why can’t we use ½·m·v² to describe spinning motion?,It’s not energy,Velocity is angular,Mass changes,It ignores radius and rotation,D,Rotational motion requires inertia and radius to calculate energy: ½·I·ω².
What variable in ½·I·ω² is most like 'mass' in translational KE?,ω,I,m,v,B,Moment of inertia (I) in rotational systems plays the same role as mass (m) in translational systems.
Which situation shows both forms of kinetic energy?,Object sliding on ice,Rolling tire,Spinning fan blade,Stationary disk,B,"A rolling tire moves linearly and rotates, so it has both ½·m·v² and ½·I·ω²."
Why is it incorrect to say KE = ½·m·v² for a spinning object?,Because spinning isn’t energy,Because gravity isn’t involved,Because it includes I and ω,Because v doesn’t exist,C,Rotational kinetic energy uses different variables: moment of inertia and angular velocity.
"If two objects have the same mass but different I, which has more rotational KE?",They’re equal,It depends on velocity,The one with less I,The one with more I if ω is constant,D,"If ω is the same, the object with larger I will have more KE = ½·I·ω²."
Which expression correctly combines rotational and translational KE?,KE = m·v + I·ω,KE = m·v,KE = ½·I·v²,KE = ½·m·v² + ½·I·ω²,D,Total kinetic energy for rolling motion combines ½·m·v² and ½·I·ω².
