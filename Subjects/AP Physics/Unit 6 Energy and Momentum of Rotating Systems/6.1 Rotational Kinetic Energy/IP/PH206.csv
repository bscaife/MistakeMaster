Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What variable does rotational kinetic energy depend on?,Linear speed (v),Angular speed (ω),Height,Mass only,B,Rotational kinetic energy is calculated using angular speed: KE = ½·I·ω².
Why is it incorrect to use v in ½·I·ω²?,v is irrelevant,They give the same result,ω represents angular motion,v is a constant,C,"Rotational KE depends on angular velocity (ω), not translational speed (v)."
Which of the following affects rotational kinetic energy?,v,m,g,ω,D,Angular speed (ω) determines rotational KE: KE = ½·I·ω².
A disk spins but does not move linearly. What contributes to its kinetic energy?,Its height,Its angular velocity,Its radius,Its mass only,B,"Without translational motion, the kinetic energy comes solely from rotation via ω."
What equation represents the energy of a rotating body?,½·m·v²,½·I·ω²,m·g·h,I·v²,B,Rotational kinetic energy is expressed as ½·I·ω².
Which change increases a spinning object’s KE the most?,Doubling radius,Doubling v,Doubling ω,Reducing mass,C,"KE = ½·I·ω². Since ω is squared, increasing it has a large effect on energy."
Why can’t you plug v into the rotational KE formula?,v is not a rotational quantity,It gives mass instead,It leads to translational energy,v and ω are the same,A,"Rotational energy formulas require angular variables like ω, not v."
"Which object has more rotational KE, assuming same I?",One with higher mass,One with larger radius,One with higher ω,One with higher v,C,"If I is constant, rotational KE increases with angular speed (ω)."
"If an object rotates faster but doesn't move linearly, what happens to KE?",It decreases,It stays the same,It becomes zero,It increases due to ω,D,Higher ω increases rotational kinetic energy: KE = ½·I·ω².
What’s the key distinction between translational and rotational KE?,"Translational uses v, rotational uses ω",Only direction differs,Rotational KE is always less,They’re identical,A,"Translational KE = ½·m·v², while rotational KE = ½·I·ω²."
