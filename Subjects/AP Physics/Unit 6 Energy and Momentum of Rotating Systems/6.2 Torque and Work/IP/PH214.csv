Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
How does the angle of applied force affect rotational work?,It doesn’t matter,Work is maximized at 0°,Work is minimized at 45°,Work is maximized at 90°,D,Maximum torque — and therefore maximum work — occurs when force is perpendicular: sin(90°) = 1.
Which torque angle produces the most work?,0°,90°,45°,180°,B,"Torque is τ = r·F·sin(θ), and sin(90°) gives the maximum value."
What happens to torque — and therefore work — when the force is aligned with the radius (θ = 0°)?,It’s zero,It’s half as strong,It's maximized,It reverses,A,"When θ = 0°, sin(θ) = 0, so no torque is produced and no work is done."
What is the rotational analog of W = F·d·cos(θ)?,W = τ·ω,W = I·α,W = r·F·sin(θ)·θ,W = m·g·h,C,"W = τ·θ, and τ = r·F·sin(θ), so W = r·F·sin(θ)·θ shows angle dependence."
At which angle is no rotational work done?,60°,45°,90°,0°,D,"When the force is along the lever arm (θ = 0°), no torque or work occurs."
Why does angle matter in torque and work?,It changes gravity,It determines effective force direction,It affects moment of inertia,It changes radius,B,Only the perpendicular component of force contributes to torque and work.
Which equation includes angle’s effect on torque and work?,τ = r·F·cos(θ),W = F·d,W = m·a·d,τ = r·F·sin(θ),D,Torque uses the sine of the angle between force and lever arm: τ = r·F·sin(θ).
A student says angle doesn’t affect work. What’s the fix?,Only speed affects it,Angle affects force’s effectiveness,Mass changes energy,It depends on temperature,B,The force’s angle affects the torque generated — only the perpendicular part matters.
What is sin(90°) in torque calculations?,0,½,1,Undefined,C,"sin(90°) = 1, meaning full force is applied perpendicularly — max torque and work."
Why is torque zero at θ = 0° or 180°?,No rotation exists,Radius disappears,Force is parallel to lever arm,Velocity is zero,C,"Torque = r·F·sin(θ); when θ = 0° or 180°, sin(θ) = 0 and no torque/work is done."
