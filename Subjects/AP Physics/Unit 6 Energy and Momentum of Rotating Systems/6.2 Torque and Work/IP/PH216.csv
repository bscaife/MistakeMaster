Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does rotational work do to a system?,Adds torque,Changes angular momentum,Increases moment of inertia,Transfers energy,D,Rotational work (W = τ·θ) changes the system’s rotational kinetic energy.
Which equation shows energy added to rotation?,W = τ·θ,W = F·d,W = m·g·h,W = I·α,A,W = τ·θ represents the energy transferred by torque causing angular displacement.
A torque spins up a wheel. What happens to its energy?,Rotational KE increases,It decreases,It stays the same,Mass increases,A,"Torque does positive work, increasing rotational kinetic energy: KE = ½·I·ω²."
What kind of energy does torque produce through work?,Thermal energy,Rotational kinetic energy,Translational energy,Potential energy,B,Torque causes rotation — the energy increase shows up in ½·I·ω².
Which variable increases as a result of rotational work?,ω,Radius,Mass,Height,A,"Work adds energy, increasing angular velocity (ω) and thus rotational KE."
A student says torque doesn’t transfer energy. What’s the fix?,Only linear force does work,Torque changes rotational KE through work,Energy is only in mass,Torque stores momentum,B,Rotational work changes KE: W = τ·θ affects ½·I·ω².
Which concept is rotational work directly tied to?,Acceleration,Friction,Energy transfer,Inertia,C,"Like linear work, rotational work represents energy transfer into or out of rotation."
When is energy transferred to rotation?,Only when α = 0,Only when ω = 0,When τ and θ are both nonzero,Only when m increases,C,Work requires torque and angular displacement: W = τ·θ.
How does torque increase an object’s energy?,By reducing mass,By changing radius,By doing work over an angle,By increasing inertia,C,Work = τ·θ adds energy by turning torque into motion.
Which statement best connects torque to energy?,Torque does not affect energy,Only force changes energy,Energy only changes with mass,Rotational work transfers energy via τ·θ,D,Rotational work (W = τ·θ) transfers energy to or from rotational KE.
