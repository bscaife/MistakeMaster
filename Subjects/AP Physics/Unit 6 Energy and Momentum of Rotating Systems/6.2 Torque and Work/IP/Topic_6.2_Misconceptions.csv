Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH211,Work and torque are unrelated,"Fails to understand that work can be done by a torque, just as it can be done by a linear force over displacement."
PH212,Rotational work depends only on torque,Ignores that both torque and angular displacement are required for calculating work done in rotational motion.
PH213,Work in rotation is always positive,"Assumes torque always adds energy, not realizing torque in the opposite direction can remove energy."
PH214,Work is the same regardless of the angle,"Does not consider that work varies with the angle of torque application, just as in linear work with force direction."
PH215,Only complete rotations produce work,"Believes that torque must result in full revolutions to count as work, ignoring continuous accumulation of energy over small angular displacements."
PH216,Rotational work is not energy,"Fails to recognize that work done by torque changes rotational kinetic energy, just as linear work affects translational energy."
PH217,Area under a torque graph means nothing,"Overlooks that the area under a torque vs. angle graph equals work done, paralleling force vs. displacement graphs."
