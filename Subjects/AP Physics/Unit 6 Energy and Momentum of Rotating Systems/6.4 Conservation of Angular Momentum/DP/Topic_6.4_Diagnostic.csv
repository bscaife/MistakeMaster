Question,Correct Answer,Choice A,Correct? A,Code A,Choice B,Correct? B,Code B,Choice C,Correct? C,Code C,Choice D,Correct? D,Code D,Explanation
Which condition is required for angular momentum to be conserved?,C,Angular velocity must be constant.,False,PH225,Moment of inertia must be zero.,False,PH225,No net external torque acts on the system.,True,,The system must rotate clockwise.,False,PH225,Conservation of angular momentum requires ∑τₑₓₜ = 0
A skater reduces her I by pulling in her arms. What happens to ω and L?,D,Both increase.,False,PH226,Both decrease.,False,PH226,ω stays same; L decreases.,False,PH226,ω increases; L stays constant.,True,,I·ω = constant → if I ↓ then ω ↑ to conserve L
Two rotating disks (I₁— I₂) with ω₁— ω₂ stick together. What is ω_f?,B,ω_f = I₁ + I₂,False,PH231,ω_f = (I₁·ω₁ + I₂·ω₂) / (I₁ + I₂),True,,ω_f = (ω₁ + ω₂) / 2,False,PH226,ω_f = I₁ / ω₂,False,PH226,Use L₁ + L₂ = (I₁ + I₂) · ω_f → solve for ω_f
An object’s I changes but L stays constant. What happens to ω?,A,It adjusts so that L = I·ω remains constant.,True,,It decreases to zero.,False,PH231,It increases without limit.,False,PH231,It becomes negative.,False,PH231,L = I·ω → constant L → ω ∝ 1/I
If L is conserved— what can cause ω to increase?,D,A net torque.,False,PH225,Increasing mass.,False,PH231,Adding external forces.,False,PH231,Reducing moment of inertia.,True,,ω = L / I → decrease I → increase ω
A student says angular momentum is always conserved. What’s wrong?,B,They are correct.,False,PH225,It only holds without external torques.,True,,It depends on direction.,False,PH225,It reverses in collisions.,False,PH225,External torques can change L
What must be true for a rotating system to conserve angular momentum?,A,Net external torque is zero.,True,,Angular velocity is constant.,False,PH226,Mass stays constant.,False,PH225,Friction is present.,False,PH225,L is only conserved if ∑τₑₓₜ = 0
Which equation represents conservation of angular momentum?,C,I₁·α₁ = I₂·α₂,False,PH231,I₁ + I₂ = constant,False,PH225,I₁·ω₁ = I₂·ω₂,True,,L = τ · t,False,PH225,L = I·ω → L₁ = L₂ → I₁·ω₁ = I₂·ω₂
An object’s angular velocity triples while L stays the same. What happens to I?,B,It triples.,False,PH231,It becomes one-third.,True,,It stays constant.,False,PH231,It becomes zero.,False,PH231,L = I·ω → I ∝ 1/ω
Why can L be conserved even if I and ω change?,D,Because energy is conserved.,False,PH231,Because torque is external.,False,PH225,Because direction is fixed.,False,PH231,Because their product stays constant.,True,,L = I·ω → if one increases and other decreases proportionally— L stays the same
