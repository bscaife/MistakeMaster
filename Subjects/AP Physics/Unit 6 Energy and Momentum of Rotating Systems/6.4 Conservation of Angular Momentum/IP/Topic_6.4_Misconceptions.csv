Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH225,Angular momentum is always constant,"Assumes angular momentum can’t change, ignoring the role of net external torque on a system."
PH226,Angular momentum can’t exist without rotation,Fails to understand that linear motion can contribute to angular momentum when measured about a point not on the object's path.
PH227,Objects must be connected to exchange angular momentum,"Believes interaction requires physical contact, not realizing torque can arise through forces at a distance."
PH228,Angular momentum changes require changes in speed only,"Ignores that redistributing mass relative to axis (e.g., pulling in arms) can alter angular momentum or angular speed."
PH229,External forces always change angular momentum,"Thinks any force changes angular momentum, not distinguishing between torque (causing rotation) and linear forces."
PH230,Only rigid bodies conserve angular momentum,Doesn’t recognize that non-rigid systems can still obey conservation laws when no external torque acts.
PH231,Moment of inertia is constant for all rotations,"Assumes moment of inertia doesn’t change with shape or mass distribution, even during deformation or reconfiguration."
