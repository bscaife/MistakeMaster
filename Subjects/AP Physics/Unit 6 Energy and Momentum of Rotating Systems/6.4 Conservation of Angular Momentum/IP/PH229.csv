Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Do all external forces change angular momentum?,"Yes, force always changes momentum","No, only forces that produce torque do",Only if rotation exists,Only with constant mass,B,Only external forces that create torque about a point can change angular momentum.
Which type of force changes angular momentum?,Any contact force,Only a force that acts at a distance from a pivot,Only friction,Only weight,B,Only forces that cause torque can change L — torque = force × lever arm.
A force acts through the center of mass. What happens to angular momentum?,It stays the same,It reverses,It increases,It becomes undefined,A,A force through the center causes no torque — no change in angular momentum.
What is needed for a force to change L?,Force must create torque,Change in radius,Constant ω,Object must be spinning,A,Angular momentum changes when an external torque is applied — not just any force.
Which equation connects torque to change in angular momentum?,τ = ΔL/t,F = m·a,W = τ·θ,L = m·v·r,A,Angular momentum changes when there is a net torque — τ = ΔL/t (no calculus form used).
A student says all forces affect angular momentum. What’s the correction?,Angular velocity doesn’t matter,Friction cancels force,Mass is constant,Forces through the axis do not produce torque,D,"For a force to change L, it must cause torque — a force through the pivot has no lever arm."
Which example shows angular momentum staying constant?,Torque applied for 5s,Force acts off-center,Force acts through pivot,Angular acceleration increases,C,A force through the axis causes no torque and doesn’t change angular momentum.
When does an external force not affect angular momentum?,Always,If it causes rotation,If it has no lever arm,If it's friction,C,"If the force’s line of action passes through the axis, no torque — L stays constant."
What causes change in L?,Force at any point,Higher speed,Energy increase,Torque from force not through center,D,L changes only if a force causes torque — not just any force.
Which situation will not affect angular momentum?,Friction applied off-center,Thrust causing rotation,Force through pivot point,Gravity pulling on edge,C,No torque means no angular momentum change — even if a force is applied.
