Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can angular momentum exist without rotation?,"Yes, if object moves near a point",Only with angular velocity,"No, it needs spinning",Only if ω is nonzero,A,Objects moving in a straight line can have angular momentum about an offset point.
A rock moves straight past a pole. Does it have angular momentum?,"No, it’s not spinning","Yes, relative to the pole",Only with rotation,Only if mass is large,B,Its linear motion contributes to angular momentum about the pole.
Which formula accounts for angular momentum from linear motion?,L = I·ω,L = F·d,L = m·v·r,L = ½·m·v²,C,Angular momentum relative to a point: L = m·v·r⊥ applies even without rotation.
What causes angular momentum without spin?,Friction,Rotational KE,Circular force,Linear motion past a reference point,D,A mass moving past a reference point creates angular momentum about that point.
Which situation has angular momentum with no rotation?,Spinning top,A ball rolling in a circle,Car passing a traffic cone,Fan spinning on a desk,C,Linear motion near a fixed point gives rise to angular momentum.
A student says spin is needed for angular momentum. What’s the correction?,That’s true only in space,Only for circular motion,It depends on gravity,Angular momentum can come from straight-line motion near a point,D,Linear motion offset from a point gives angular momentum relative to that point.
What is L for a sliding puck passing a post?,Zero,Depends on angle,It’s spinning,m·v·r⊥,D,L = m·v·r⊥ is the angular momentum relative to a point for a linearly moving object.
What does angular momentum depend on for a non-rotating object?,"Mass, velocity, and distance from point",Just spin,Only force,Only rotation,A,Non-rotating objects can still have angular momentum relative to an external point.
"A car drives in a straight line past a tree. Relative to the tree, it has...",Angular momentum,No energy,No velocity,Only linear momentum,A,The car’s velocity at a distance from the tree means it has angular momentum about that point.
Which variable is not needed for angular momentum from linear motion?,Mass,Torque,Velocity,Distance to point,B,"Torque causes angular momentum change, but isn’t needed to calculate L for moving masses."
