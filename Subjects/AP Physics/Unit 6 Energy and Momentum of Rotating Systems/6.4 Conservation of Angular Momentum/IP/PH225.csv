Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
When is angular momentum constant?,Always,When torque is applied,Only when ω is constant,When there’s no net external torque,D,Angular momentum is conserved only when no external torque acts on the system.
Which condition breaks conservation of angular momentum?,Rotation,Constant ω,External torque,Symmetry,C,An external torque acting on the system causes angular momentum to change.
A spinning skater slows due to friction. What changes?,Angular momentum,Time,Mass,Kinetic energy only,A,The external torque from friction reduces angular momentum.
Which system will conserve angular momentum?,A planet orbiting without drag,A spinning top on a rough surface,A bicycle braking,A fan in water,A,"With no external torques like drag or friction, angular momentum is conserved."
What causes angular momentum to change?,Mass increase,Time passing,Constant radius,External torque,D,Only external torque causes a change in angular momentum.
A student says angular momentum never changes. What’s the fix?,That’s true if time is constant,It changes when net torque acts,It only changes with mass,It changes when I increases,B,Net external torque leads to angular momentum change.
Which equation helps predict angular momentum changes?,W = τ·θ,L = m·v,τ = I·α,F = m·a,C,"τ = I·α implies that net torque leads to angular acceleration, changing angular momentum."
What does an unbalanced torque do?,Maintains energy,Stops inertia,Changes angular momentum,Changes height,C,An unbalanced torque results in a change in rotational motion and angular momentum.
Why does a rolling ball slow down over time?,Because net torque from friction slows it,Because mass increases,Because angular momentum is constant,Because inertia grows,A,Friction is an external torque that reduces angular momentum.
Which system shows angular momentum decreasing?,A skater pulling in arms,A satellite in space,A balanced seesaw,A fan spinning in air,D,"Air resistance applies an external torque, reducing angular momentum."
