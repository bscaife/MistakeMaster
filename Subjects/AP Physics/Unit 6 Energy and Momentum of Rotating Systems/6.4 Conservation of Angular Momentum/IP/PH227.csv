Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can angular momentum be transferred without direct contact?,"Yes, if there's a force acting at a distance","No, objects must be touching",Only if rotation is involved,Only if both objects spin,A,Torque from forces like gravity or tension can transfer angular momentum without physical connection.
A moon orbits a planet. Can angular momentum be exchanged?,Only if they touch,Only through collisions,Only if the moon spins,"Yes, through gravitational torque",D,"Gravity exerts torque on the moon, changing angular momentum without contact."
What allows angular momentum to change between separate objects?,Physical contact,Angular velocity,Equal mass,External torque,D,"Torque applied across distance, like tension or gravity, can cause angular momentum changes."
Which interaction transfers angular momentum without touching?,Spinning gear mesh,Gravitational pull from another mass,Electric repulsion,Elastic collision,B,Gravitational interactions can cause torques at a distance.
What is required to change an object’s angular momentum?,A rotating neighbor,"A torque, even at a distance",Mass transfer,Friction,B,Torque causes angular momentum to change — it doesn’t require physical contact.
Why can torque occur without connection?,All torques are internal,Only torque from spin matters,Forces can act through fields,Mass causes torque directly,C,Fields like gravity or electromagnetism can create torque without objects touching.
Which system shows angular momentum change without contact?,Rocket in space rotating due to thrust,Spinning fan,Two bouncing balls,Hinged beam,A,Thrust applies torque without touching — momentum changes without contact.
A student says torque needs contact. What’s the fix?,Only tension is distant,Forces at a distance like gravity cause torque,Contact helps but isn’t required,It depends on shape,B,"Gravity, tension, and fields can apply torque across space."
Why does a rope cause angular momentum change in a swinging ball?,Because it's light,Because it stops spin,Because it adds mass,Because it pulls from a distance,D,The rope tension applies torque at a distance from the pivot.
Which of the following applies torque without contact?,Fan blade hitting air,Two clashing gears,Gravity pulling on a moon,Hammer strike,C,Gravitational force applies torque even when objects are far apart.
