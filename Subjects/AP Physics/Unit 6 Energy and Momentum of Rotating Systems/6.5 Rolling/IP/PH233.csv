Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does friction always slow down rolling motion?,"No, static friction allows rolling",Only when it’s static friction,"Yes, it always resists motion","Yes, if the object is spinning",A,Static friction enables rolling without slipping — it does not always reduce speed.
What kind of friction supports rolling without slipping?,Static,Kinetic,Fluid,Air resistance,A,Static friction matches the ground speed and prevents sliding — it helps maintain smooth rolling.
A student says friction always opposes motion. What's the correction for rolling?,It always causes heat,It can assist rolling without reducing speed,It increases speed,It causes acceleration,B,Friction may assist motion by enabling a torque — static friction enables rolling without loss of energy.
Why is friction required for a ball to roll instead of slide?,To stop the ball,To cause heat,To reduce angular velocity,To create torque and rotation,D,Friction provides torque that causes rotation — it is essential for rolling.
Which of the following is true about static friction and rolling?,It always slows down the object,It’s unnecessary for rolling,It allows rolling without slipping,It prevents rotation,C,"Static friction locks the contact point, enabling clean rolling motion."
Which condition shows friction helping motion?,Tire spinning on ice,Object sliding on ice,Ball rolling on dry floor,Airplane braking,C,"Dry surfaces allow static friction, which helps wheels roll without skidding."
What does static friction do during ideal rolling?,Reduces total energy,Prevents slip at contact,Produces linear acceleration,Increases torque,B,Static friction prevents slipping and maintains the rolling condition.
What force provides torque for a wheel to roll forward?,Weight,Kinetic friction,Static friction,Normal force,C,Static friction creates torque that spins the wheel in the direction of travel.
Which of the following is NOT true for static friction?,It can act forward or backward,It always slows motion,It can prevent slipping,It’s needed for rolling,B,Static friction does not always oppose motion — it can assist rolling.
Why can static friction be non-dissipative?,It doesn't result in sliding,It doesn’t apply torque,It only affects linear motion,It’s equal to zero,A,Static friction doesn’t do work in rolling because there’s no relative motion at contact.
