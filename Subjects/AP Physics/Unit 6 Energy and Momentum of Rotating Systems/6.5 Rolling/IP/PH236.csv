Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What two types of motion are involved in rolling without slipping?,Only angular,Only linear,Gravitational and normal,Translational and rotational,D,Rolling combines rotation about the axis and translation of the center of mass.
Which energy types does a rolling object have?,Both rotational and translational,Only translational,Only rotational,Only potential,A,A rolling object has both ½·m·v² and ½·I·ω² — it’s both spinning and moving forward.
A student says only spin matters in rolling. What’s the correction?,Rolling is purely rotational,Rolling includes linear motion of the center,Rotation always dominates,Translation cancels out,B,The center of mass moves linearly while the object also rotates.
What happens to the center of mass in rolling motion?,It stays in place,It rotates,It moves forward,It bounces,C,The center of mass moves in a straight line — this is translational motion.
Which of the following is true for a rolling ball?,Only I·ω matters,Only torque affects it,It has no linear motion,Its center moves with velocity v,D,A rolling ball’s center of mass moves forward — it has velocity v.
Why does rolling without slipping involve v = ω·r?,To connect rotation to translation,To balance energy,To reduce force,To reduce I,A,This equation ensures the contact point is stationary — it links the two motions.
Which formula gives the total energy of a rolling object?,½·I·ω²,½·m·v² + ½·I·ω²,½·m·v²,m·g·h,B,Total kinetic energy includes both rotational and translational components.
What is true about a rolling object's center of mass?,It rotates,It accelerates forward,It moves in a circle,It remains still,B,The center of mass moves forward — that’s the object’s translational motion.
Which of these proves rolling has translation?,The object spins in place,The surface has high friction,The center of mass changes position,The object rotates faster,C,"If the center of mass moves forward, the object is translating while rolling."
Which system shows pure rotation without translation?,Rolling tire,Wheel down a ramp,Spinning disk in place,Ball on a track,C,A disk spinning without moving its center has no translational motion.
