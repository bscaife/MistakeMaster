Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does friction always reduce energy in rolling motion?,"Yes, always",Only when it's static friction,Not when it's static friction in ideal rolling,Only at high speeds,C,Static friction enables rolling without slipping and does no work — it doesn’t reduce energy.
When does friction NOT dissipate energy?,When rolling without slipping,When sliding occurs,When it's kinetic,When speed increases,A,"In ideal rolling, static friction prevents slip but doesn’t do work — no energy loss occurs."
A student says all friction wastes energy. What's the fix for rolling?,Kinetic friction doesn't exist,Only air drag does work,Static friction can assist motion without doing work,Static friction causes heating,C,Static friction doesn’t cause energy loss unless slipping occurs.
What kind of friction causes energy dissipation?,Static,Normal force,Ideal,Kinetic,D,Kinetic friction causes heat and energy loss — unlike static friction in rolling.
Why does static friction do no work in rolling without slipping?,Because mass is constant,Because there is no relative motion at contact,Because torque is balanced,Because velocity is zero,B,Static friction does no work if there's no displacement at the contact point.
Which situation involves static friction with no energy loss?,Wheel skidding,Sled moving downhill,Block sliding on floor,Ball rolling smoothly,D,A smoothly rolling ball involves static friction that maintains motion without sliding.
What is the energy role of static friction in rolling?,Adds thermal energy,Enables motion without energy loss,Removes torque,Stops rotation,B,Static friction enables torque without doing work if rolling is ideal.
Which of the following causes energy dissipation?,Rolling without slipping,Sliding with kinetic friction,Static friction,Balanced torques,B,Kinetic friction from sliding causes energy to convert to heat.
What must happen for friction to reduce mechanical energy?,Normal force must increase,The object must be heavy,Friction must act with sliding,Angular velocity must increase,C,Friction only reduces energy when there is slipping — not in pure rolling.
Which friction type is non-dissipative during motion?,Static friction in rolling,Kinetic friction on ice,Drag force,Friction on loose sand,A,Static friction in ideal rolling does no work — it enables motion without energy loss.
