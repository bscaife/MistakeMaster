Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH232,Rolling objects slide by default,"Assumes that rolling motion includes slipping unless friction is explicitly mentioned, ignoring 'rolling without slipping' conditions."
PH233,Friction always slows down rolling,Fails to realize that static friction is necessary for rolling without slipping and may not reduce speed.
PH234,Translational and rotational energy are the same,"Confuses or merges the two forms of kinetic energy in rolling systems, failing to distinguish between them."
PH235,Friction dissipates energy in all rolling cases,"Believes any friction results in energy loss, not recognizing that static friction in ideal rolling does no work."
PH236,Only rotation matters in rolling motion,"Ignores the translational motion of the center of mass in rolling systems, focusing only on the spin."
PH237,No friction means rolling still occurs,"Assumes rolling without slipping is possible on frictionless surfaces, overlooking the role of static friction."
PH238,Rolling speed is the same for all shapes,Thinks all objects roll down a ramp at the same rate regardless of mass distribution and moment of inertia.
