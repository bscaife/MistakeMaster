Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the difference between translational and rotational kinetic energy?,There is no difference,They are measured the same way,They depend on different variables,They only apply to rotation,C,"Translational KE = ½·m·v², rotational KE = ½·I·ω² — they use different variables."
A rolling object has what kind of kinetic energy?,Only translational,Both translational and rotational,Only rotational,Only potential,B,Rolling involves both linear motion (½·m·v²) and rotation (½·I·ω²).
Which of these represents rotational kinetic energy?,½·m·v²,m·g·h,½·I·ω²,F·d,C,Rotational kinetic energy uses the moment of inertia and angular velocity: ½·I·ω².
Which quantity is found in translational but not rotational energy?,v,m,ω,I,A,"Translational energy uses linear speed (v), while rotational energy uses angular speed (ω)."
A student says ½·m·v² equals ½·I·ω². What’s the correction?,They're both energy so they’re the same,It depends on shape only,It depends on mass only,Each applies to a different kind of motion,D,"One is for linear motion, the other for rotational motion — they’re not interchangeable."
Which object has more rotational energy?,One spinning quickly,One sliding fast,One at rest,One thrown straight up,A,Only the spinning object has rotational kinetic energy: ½·I·ω².
Which pair shows both types of kinetic energy?,Stationary sphere,Ball dropped straight down,Spinning disk in place,Rolling ball,D,"A rolling ball translates and rotates, so it has both ½·m·v² and ½·I·ω²."
Which formula gives total kinetic energy for rolling without slipping?,KE = ½·m·v²,KE = ½·m·v² + ½·I·ω²,KE = ½·I·ω²,KE = m·v·r,B,Total KE is the sum of translational and rotational terms.
Why do translational and rotational energy differ?,They rely on different physical motions,They come from the same formula,They are the same in direction,They cancel each other,A,Translational motion is linear; rotational involves spinning around an axis.
A ball rolls to a stop. Which energy decreased?,Only ½·m·v²,Only ½·I·ω²,Both translational and rotational,Only gravitational potential,C,Rolling to a stop reduces both types of kinetic energy.
