Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What does 'rolling without slipping' mean?,The point in contact is momentarily at rest,It has no friction,The object moves smoothly over ice,It accelerates uniformly,A,"In rolling without slipping, the point of contact does not slide — it has zero velocity relative to the surface."
Which force ensures rolling without slipping?,Tension,Gravity,Static friction,Kinetic friction,C,Static friction prevents slipping and allows the object to roll smoothly.
A student says rolling always includes sliding. What’s the correction?,Slipping increases with time,Rolling without slipping means no slide,Only rotating objects can slip,Mass prevents sliding,B,Rolling without slipping is a well-defined condition in physics — it means no sliding occurs.
When does a rolling object NOT slide?,When static friction is present,Always,Only on ice,Only when ω = 0,A,Static friction enables rolling without slipping by locking the contact point.
What happens at the contact point in rolling without slipping?,It slides forward,It spins faster,It is instantaneously at rest,It bounces,C,The contact point has zero velocity relative to the surface — no slipping.
Why doesn’t a bowling ball slip on a rough surface?,Its weight cancels friction,It has angular momentum,Kinetic energy is conserved,Friction causes it to roll without slipping,D,Static friction matches forces to allow the ball to roll cleanly without sliding.
Which condition implies rolling without slipping?,τ = I·α,F = m·a,v = ω·r,a = ω·r²,C,v = ω·r is the rolling condition that ensures no relative motion at the contact point.
Which situation involves slipping?,A wheel on dry pavement,A tire accelerating too fast on ice,A ball rotating in place,A rotating fan,B,"On ice, low friction allows slipping — rolling without slipping fails."
What is true about velocity at the contact point for rolling without slipping?,It is zero,It reverses,It matches the center,It’s constant,A,The contact point is instantaneously stationary relative to the surface.
Why does a ball begin to roll without slipping after a brief slide?,It gains energy,Friction reduces rotation,It becomes heavier,Friction increases ω until v = ω·r,D,Static friction acts to bring v and ω into the rolling without slipping condition.
