Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can an object roll without slipping on a frictionless surface?,"Yes, rolling doesn’t need friction",Only if mass is small,"No, static friction is required",Only if force is applied,C,Static friction is necessary to produce torque and prevent slipping — it allows rolling to begin.
Why can’t a ball roll on ice without friction?,It’s too slippery,It needs air resistance,It requires torque from static friction,It bounces,C,"Without static friction, no torque can act to start rotation."
What role does static friction play in rolling?,It prevents slipping,It increases weight,It slows rotation,It adds energy,A,Static friction ensures the contact point doesn’t slide — essential for rolling without slipping.
A sphere starts on a frictionless slope. What happens?,It spins and slides,It rolls without slipping,It accelerates rotationally only,It stays still,A,"Without friction, it cannot roll — it slides and may spin independently."
Which force enables torque in rolling motion?,Normal force,Tension,Gravity,Static friction,D,Static friction applies a torque that starts rotational motion.
A student says a sphere rolls on ice. What’s the correction?,"It slides and spins, not rolls",It rolls faster,It rolls slower,It reverses direction,A,No static friction means no rolling — it slides instead.
Which condition is required for rolling without slipping?,Low mass,Static friction,High speed,Balanced torque,B,Static friction must be present for rolling to occur without slipping.
Why doesn’t rolling happen on ice?,Mass is too low,No static friction exists,Normal force is weak,It has too much inertia,B,Frictionless ice means no torque can act to start rolling.
What happens to angular velocity if a ball slides on ice?,It stays zero,It increases due to friction,It remains constant,"It increases from slipping, not friction",D,"The ball may begin to spin, but without friction it can’t link rotation and translation."
Which of these proves static friction is required?,A block falling vertically,A car accelerating on ice cannot roll,A mass hanging on a string,A puck gliding,B,No friction on ice means no rolling occurs — the wheels can’t grip the surface.
