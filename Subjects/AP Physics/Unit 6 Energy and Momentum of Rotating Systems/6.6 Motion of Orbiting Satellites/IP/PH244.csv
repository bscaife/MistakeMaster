Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Where is gravitational potential energy defined as zero in orbital mechanics?,At infinity,At sea level,At Earth’s surface,At the moon’s orbit,A,"In orbital systems, potential energy is defined to be zero infinitely far from the central mass."
What is the sign of gravitational potential energy near Earth?,Positive,Zero,Negative,Undefined,C,"Since U = -G·M·m/r, gravitational potential energy is negative near Earth."
A student says gravitational potential is zero on Earth's surface. What’s the correction?,It’s zero at the moon,It’s lowest at the center,It increases as you go down,It’s negative near Earth and zero at infinity,D,Potential energy increases (becomes less negative) as you move away from Earth — zero is at infinity.
Why is gravitational potential energy negative in orbit?,To show it's less than kinetic,Because it’s imaginary,Because energy is measured relative to zero at infinity,Because mass is zero,C,The negative sign reflects binding energy — energy is required to escape to U = 0 at infinity.
What happens to gravitational potential energy as you move farther from Earth?,It becomes more negative,It becomes less negative,It stays the same,It turns positive,B,It increases toward zero as you get farther from Earth — U = -G·M·m/r.
Which of the following is true about U = -G·M·m/r?,U is positive near the surface,U is zero at the center of Earth,U increases as r decreases,U increases with r,D,Gravitational potential energy becomes less negative (increases) as distance increases.
Why is gravitational potential energy negative in orbital mechanics?,It reflects gravitational repulsion,Because it matches KE,It’s always positive,It’s a reference choice with zero at infinity,D,This convention reflects how much energy would be required to escape to an unbound state (U = 0 at ∞).
Which location has the highest gravitational potential energy (least negative)?,Infinity,Geosynchronous orbit,Lunar orbit,Earth’s surface,A,U approaches zero as r approaches infinity — this is the highest possible value.
"If U = 0 at infinity, what does U = -50 MJ near Earth mean?",It’s gaining energy,It’s in a bound state needing 50 MJ to escape,It’s unbound,It’s not moving,B,Negative potential energy indicates a bound object — you’d need 50 MJ to remove it from Earth’s pull.
Which of these correctly uses orbital gravitational potential energy?,U = m·g·h,U = G·m/r,U = -G·M·m/r,U = ½·mv²,C,Only U = -G·M·m/r applies for objects far from Earth in orbital or celestial mechanics.
