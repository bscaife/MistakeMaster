Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Why do satellites stay in orbit around Earth?,Because gravity acts as a centripetal force,Because they are weightless,Because there is no gravity,Because they move in a straight line,A,"Gravity pulls the satellite toward Earth, constantly changing its direction — this keeps it in orbit."
What force keeps a satellite in circular motion around a planet?,Gravity,Air pressure,Normal force,Friction,A,Gravity provides the inward force needed for centripetal acceleration in orbits.
A student says gravity is absent in space. What’s the correction?,"Gravity is weak, not absent",Only heavy objects feel gravity,Mass disappears in orbit,Gravity is what keeps objects in orbit,D,Satellites are in constant free fall toward the planet due to gravity.
Why don’t satellites fall straight down?,They are pulled up,They are moving forward while falling,There is no gravity,Earth repels them,B,"Their horizontal motion keeps them constantly falling around the planet, not into it."
Which type of motion best describes a satellite’s path?,Straight line,Uniform acceleration,Random drift,Free-fall in a curved path,D,Orbital motion is curved free-fall due to gravity acting at a right angle to velocity.
Which of the following is NOT true about satellites in orbit?,They are weightless,They feel gravity,They escape gravity,They are falling,C,They do not escape gravity — they are in constant gravitational pull.
What happens to a satellite if gravity suddenly disappeared?,It would stop moving,It would move in a straight line,It would crash,It would spin faster,B,"Without gravity, there is no centripetal force — it would follow Newton’s First Law in a straight line."
What causes the curved motion of an orbit?,Gravity changing speed,Friction from space,Gravity changing direction of velocity,Rotation of Earth,C,Gravity constantly redirects the satellite’s velocity inward — curving its path.
Why do astronauts appear weightless in orbit?,There is no gravity,They are floating due to magnetism,Air pressure is low,They are moving with gravity in free-fall,D,They are falling at the same rate as their spacecraft — not because gravity is absent.
Which force is the same for a ball on a string and a satellite in orbit?,Tension,Friction,Centripetal force,Air resistance,C,Both systems are held in curved motion by a centripetal force — tension or gravity.
