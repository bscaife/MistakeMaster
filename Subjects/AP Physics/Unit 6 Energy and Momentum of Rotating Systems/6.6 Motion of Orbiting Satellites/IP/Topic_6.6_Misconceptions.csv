Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH239,Satellites stay in orbit because there is no gravity,"Assumes gravity is absent in orbit, not realizing it is exactly gravity that provides the centripetal force to maintain the orbit."
PH240,Orbits require constant engine thrust,"Thinks satellites must continuously fire engines to stay in orbit, rather than coasting under the influence of gravity alone."
PH241,Satellites are weightless because gravity is zero,"Confuses 'apparent weightlessness' with lack of gravity, ignoring that satellites are in free fall."
PH242,Circular orbits are the only kind of orbit,Fails to recognize that elliptical orbits are more common and governed by the same conservation principles.
PH243,Higher orbits are always faster,Does not understand that orbital speed decreases with increasing altitude due to weaker gravitational pull.
PH244,Gravitational potential energy is zero at Earth’s surface,"Ignores that potential energy is defined relative to infinity in orbital systems, not Earth’s surface."
PH245,The satellite’s energy changes in circular orbit,"Thinks energy fluctuates during circular orbit, not realizing that both kinetic and potential energy remain constant unless acted upon."
