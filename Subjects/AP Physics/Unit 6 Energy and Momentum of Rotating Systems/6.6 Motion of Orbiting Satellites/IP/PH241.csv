Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Why do astronauts feel weightless in orbit?,Because gravity is zero,Because they are in free-fall,Because there is no air,Because they spin very fast,B,Astronauts are falling with the spacecraft — they feel weightless because everything accelerates equally under gravity.
Is gravity zero at the height of the ISS?,"Yes, space has no gravity",It depends on mass,Only when orbit is high,"No, gravity is still strong",D,Gravity is still about 90% as strong at ISS altitude — it keeps them in orbit.
What does 'apparent weightlessness' mean?,Mass is zero,There is no normal force,Gravity is absent,Thrust counters gravity,B,"There’s no support force pushing back, so the sensation of weight disappears despite gravity being present."
What force keeps the ISS in orbit?,Gravity,Thrust,Tension,None,A,Gravity provides the centripetal force that bends the ISS’s path into an orbit.
Why don’t astronauts fall back to Earth?,They are weightless,They have upward lift,There is no friction,They move forward fast while falling,D,"They are always falling, but their forward motion keeps them in orbit."
A student says astronauts are floating because gravity is gone. What's the fix?,Gravity acts slightly,They're out of Earth’s pull,They’re in free-fall together with the spacecraft,They are using thrusters,C,"Weightlessness is due to falling, not gravity being gone — gravity is still acting on them."
How is free-fall related to orbiting?,They are unrelated,Free-fall has no force,Only vertical falling counts,Orbiting is horizontal free-fall,D,"In orbit, objects are constantly falling toward Earth but move sideways fast enough to miss."
Why is weightlessness felt in orbit?,No air pressure,Everything is accelerating equally,No gravity exists,Only rotation matters,B,"When all parts of the system fall together, normal forces disappear — causing weightlessness."
"If gravity were zero, what would happen to a satellite?",It would move in a straight line,It would orbit faster,It would hover,It would crash,A,No gravity means no centripetal force — satellites would follow Newton’s First Law.
Which of the following best explains weightlessness in orbit?,Free-fall state with gravity still present,Low gravity zone,Centrifugal force cancels gravity,High-speed rotation,A,Gravity is present and causes free-fall — this shared acceleration creates apparent weightlessness.
