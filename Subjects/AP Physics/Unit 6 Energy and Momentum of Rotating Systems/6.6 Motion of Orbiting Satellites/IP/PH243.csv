Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
How does orbital speed change with altitude?,It decreases with altitude,It stays constant,It increases with altitude,It increases then decreases,A,"Gravitational force weakens with distance, so less speed is needed to maintain a higher orbit."
Why does a satellite in low orbit travel faster?,It has more energy,It experiences less gravity,It is less massive,It needs more speed to stay in orbit close to Earth,D,"Closer to Earth means stronger gravity, requiring greater speed to balance centripetal needs."
A student says higher orbit means faster satellite. What's the fix?,That’s true for small planets,Altitude doesn't affect speed,Faster speed balances lower torque,Speed decreases as gravitational pull weakens,D,Higher orbits need less speed because gravity is weaker at greater distances.
Which of these satellites moves slowest?,One at 200 km,One in geosynchronous orbit,One at 800 km,One at 500 km,B,Higher orbit = weaker gravity = slower orbital speed — geosynchronous satellites are the slowest.
What causes orbital speed to decrease with altitude?,Mass of satellite changes,Inertia increases,Gravity weakens,Air drag reduces,C,"Gravity provides centripetal force — as it weakens, less speed is needed to maintain orbit."
Which law explains the change in orbital speed with altitude?,Conservation of momentum,Newton's 1st Law,Law of inertia,Kepler’s 3rd Law,D,Kepler’s 3rd Law: longer orbital periods at higher altitudes = slower motion.
What happens to gravitational force as a satellite moves farther from Earth?,It decreases,It stays the same,It increases,It reverses,A,Gravitational force is inversely proportional to distance squared — it gets weaker with height.
Why does a geosynchronous satellite appear stationary?,It doesn’t move,It spins opposite Earth,It moves slower at a higher orbit matching Earth’s rotation,Gravity cancels out,C,It’s far enough and slow enough that it completes one orbit per 24 hours.
What allows satellites to stay in higher orbits with less speed?,They’re lighter,They’re farther from Earth's pull,They use solar sails,They have more energy,B,Weaker gravity at altitude means less speed is needed for balance.
Which of the following best describes satellite speed at high altitude?,It must be high to escape,It stays unchanged,It must be low to remain bound,It oscillates,C,High orbits need only minimal speed to stay gravitationally bound.
