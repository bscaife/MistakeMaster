Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Does a satellite’s energy change during circular orbit?,"Yes, it speeds up and slows down","Yes, gravity fluctuates","Yes, due to mass loss","No, energy stays constant unless acted upon",D,"In circular orbit, both kinetic and potential energy remain constant unless an external force acts."
What happens to total mechanical energy in circular orbit?,It increases,It decreases,It stays constant,It depends on direction,C,"No external work is done, so total energy (KE + PE) remains constant."
A student says satellite energy changes every second. What’s the fix?,Only in elliptical orbits,That’s true for high speeds,Only mass varies,Energy remains constant in circular orbit,D,"In a circular orbit, gravity and speed are constant, so energy is constant."
What condition keeps satellite speed constant in orbit?,Changing altitude,Solar radiation,Balanced centripetal force from gravity,Variable mass,C,Centripetal force from gravity matches velocity — no energy change occurs.
What is true about gravitational potential energy in circular orbit?,It oscillates,It stays constant,It changes with angle,It equals kinetic energy always,B,"Since distance from Earth is constant, gravitational potential energy remains unchanged."
Which energy condition is true for ideal circular orbits?,KE and PE are constant,PE is zero,KE fluctuates,Energy increases slowly,A,Kinetic and potential energy both remain constant — there is no energy fluctuation.
When does a satellite’s energy change in orbit?,Always,Only when an external force does work,Only when gravity acts,Only if mass changes,B,"Unless a force acts on the satellite (like a rocket burn), total energy remains constant."
Why doesn’t KE increase in circular orbit?,Speed is constant,It radiates energy away,Gravity stops it,Friction balances it,A,"In circular orbit, speed remains constant — so kinetic energy does too."
Which of these shows constant orbital energy?,Satellite descending,Satellite increasing altitude,Circular orbit at fixed altitude,Satellite colliding with debris,C,"In a stable circular orbit, energy remains unchanged unless disturbed."
What causes energy change in a circular orbit?,Gravity,An external force,Velocity,Inertia,B,Only a net force doing work (like engine thrust) changes the satellite’s energy.
