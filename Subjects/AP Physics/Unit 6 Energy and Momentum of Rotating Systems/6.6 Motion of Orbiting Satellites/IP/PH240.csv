Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Do satellites need constant engine thrust to stay in orbit?,"Yes, or they’ll fall",Only during launch,"No, they coast due to gravity","Yes, to match Earth's rotation",C,"Once in orbit, satellites coast in free-fall — gravity alone maintains the curved path."
What keeps a satellite moving in orbit?,Air resistance,Magnetism,Constant thrust,Gravity and forward velocity,D,Gravity pulls inward while forward velocity keeps the satellite falling around Earth.
A student says satellites need fuel to orbit. What’s the fix?,They coast unless changing orbit,They need thrust in space,They burn fuel slowly,Gravity repels them,A,Engines are only used to adjust orbit — not for staying in a stable orbit.
What type of motion best describes a satellite's path?,Straight line,Looping due to thrust,Accelerating upward,Free-fall around Earth,D,Satellites are constantly falling — curved paths result from forward motion + gravity.
Why don’t satellites fall straight to Earth?,They have upward lift,They have sideways velocity,They use boosters,Earth pushes them up,B,Sideways motion causes continuous free-fall around the planet.
Which of the following is NOT required to maintain an orbit?,Constant altitude,No net vertical acceleration,Constant thrust,Sufficient forward velocity,C,Thrust is not needed to maintain orbit — only to enter or change it.
Which statement is true about engines in orbit?,They run constantly,They prevent orbit decay,They are used only to adjust orbit,They provide centripetal force,C,Engines are not active during stable orbital coasting — only during maneuvers.
Which of these best explains why satellites don't fall to Earth?,Earth’s spin supports them,They are moving fast enough sideways,They repel Earth,They are weightless,B,Fast sideways motion curves the free-fall into a circular orbit.
What is the force that keeps satellites in orbit?,Thrust,Gravity,Lift,Momentum,B,"Gravity pulls them inward constantly, providing the centripetal force for orbit."
Why are orbits stable without fuel?,They use solar energy,There’s no gravity,Space vacuum supports them,Motion + gravity balance,D,The forward speed and gravity together create continuous orbit — no engine needed.
