Question,Correct Answer,Choice A,Correct? A,Code A,Choice B,Correct? B,Code B,Choice C,Correct? C,Code C,Choice D,Correct? D,Code D,Explanation
What provides the force that keeps a satellite moving in a curved path around Earth?,C,The satellite’s engine thrust,FALSE,PH240,The absence of gravity above Earth,FALSE,PH239,Earth’s gravitational pull toward the center,TRUE,,Air resistance balancing its motion,FALSE,PH239,"Earth's gravitational pull supplies the centripetal force needed to maintain orbital motion, not the absence of gravity or engine thrust."
Why don't satellites need constant engine thrust to stay in orbit?,B,"Their engines operate at low, steady power to balance gravity.",FALSE,PH240,They are moving forward and falling toward Earth simultaneously.,TRUE,,They are beyond the reach of gravity.,FALSE,PH239,Space has no forces acting on objects.,FALSE,PH239,"Satellites stay in orbit because their forward motion combines with Earth's gravitational pull, not because of ongoing thrust."
Why do astronauts inside the ISS appear to float?,A,They are in continuous free fall toward Earth.,TRUE,,There is no gravity acting at that altitude.,FALSE,PH241,Air pressure inside the station cancels weight.,FALSE,PH241,Their mass becomes zero in orbit.,FALSE,PH241,Astronauts float because they are in free fall around Earth; gravity is still present and strong at orbital altitudes.
Are all satellite orbits perfectly circular?,D,"Yes, orbits must be exact circles for stability.",FALSE,PH242,"No, they are random shapes depending on gravity.",FALSE,PH242,Only large satellites have elliptical orbits.,FALSE,PH242,"No, most orbits are slightly elliptical.",TRUE,,Most orbits are elliptical rather than perfectly circular due to the nature of gravitational forces and satellite speeds.
How does a satellite's speed change with increasing altitude?,B,Speed increases at higher orbits.,FALSE,PH243,Speed decreases because gravity weakens with distance.,TRUE,,Speed stays exactly the same at all altitudes.,FALSE,PH243,Speed depends only on the satellite's mass.,FALSE,PH243,A satellite's orbital speed decreases with greater altitude as gravitational force becomes weaker farther from Earth.
Why do satellites remain in orbit around Earth?,A,Because gravity provides the necessary centripetal force.,TRUE,,Because they are weightless and float.,FALSE,PH241,Because their engines keep them moving.,FALSE,PH239,Because there is no gravity in orbit.,FALSE,PH242,"Gravity provides the centripetal force needed for orbit, not absence of gravity or engine thrust."
"In orbit, what keeps a satellite moving along its path without falling to Earth?",C,Lack of gravitational pull.,FALSE,PH239,Zero forces acting on it.,FALSE,PH241,Its inertia and Earth's gravity pulling inward.,TRUE,,Continuous engine thrust.,FALSE,PH243,"Inertia keeps the satellite moving forward while gravity pulls it inward, creating orbital motion."
Why do astronauts feel weightless while orbiting Earth?,C,Gravity is zero in orbit.,FALSE,PH242,Their mass is reduced.,FALSE,PH241,They are in continuous free fall around Earth.,TRUE,,There is no atmospheric pressure.,FALSE,PH240,"Astronauts feel weightless because they are in free fall around Earth, not because gravity is zero."
What kind of orbit do most satellites follow around Earth?,C,A straight line with course corrections.,FALSE,PH241,A perfect circle always.,FALSE,PH239,An elliptical path governed by gravity.,TRUE,,A randomly changing path.,FALSE,PH243,"Most orbits are elliptical due to variations in speed and distance, not perfect circles."
