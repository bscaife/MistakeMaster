Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What determines how much angular momentum changes?,Just torque,Mass and inertia,Torque and time,Only angular velocity,C,Angular impulse (torque × time) causes changes in angular momentum.
Which equation shows the change in angular momentum?,L = I·ω,L = m·v·r,ΔL = τ·t,W = τ·θ,C,Angular impulse τ·t results in a change in angular momentum: ΔL = τ·t.
A student says large torque instantly changes L. What's the correction?,That’s true,Change in L depends on how long torque acts,Only if ω increases,Only when rotation stops,B,Impulse requires time — torque must act for a duration to change angular momentum.
"If you double torque but apply it for half the time, what happens to ΔL?",It doubles,It quadruples,It becomes zero,It stays the same,D,Impulse = τ·t. Doubling torque and halving time leaves impulse unchanged.
Why can’t you assume torque changes L instantly?,Because inertia resists it,Because impulse includes time,Because energy is lost,Because mass must increase,B,Angular momentum changes based on impulse — torque must act over time.
Which situation leads to the greatest change in angular momentum?,"Large torque, long time","Large torque, short time","Short torque, long time",Constant angular velocity,A,Impulse = τ·t is greatest when both torque and time are large.
What is angular impulse most similar to?,Rotational energy,Linear acceleration,Momentum,Force × time,D,Angular impulse is the rotational version of linear impulse: torque × time.
What must happen to change angular momentum?,Increase radius,Apply torque briefly,Apply torque over time,Increase ω instantly,C,Torque alone isn’t enough — it must act over time to change L.
How do you maximize angular impulse?,By applying torque longer,By reducing friction,By keeping torque steady,By rotating quickly,A,Angular impulse is maximized when torque acts for more time.
Which quantity equals angular impulse?,ΔL,I·ω,L,τ,A,Angular impulse equals the change in angular momentum: ΔL = τ·t.
