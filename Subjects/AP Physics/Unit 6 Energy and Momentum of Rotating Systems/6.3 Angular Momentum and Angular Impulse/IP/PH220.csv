Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can a non-rotating object have angular momentum?,"Yes, if it's moving relative to a point","No, it must be spinning",Only with external torque,Only with increasing velocity,A,Objects moving in a straight line have angular momentum about an external point due to m·v·r⊥.
A ball rolls past a post. What does it have relative to the post?,No momentum,Angular momentum,Only force,Only torque,B,It has angular momentum relative to the post due to its motion at a distance from that point.
What contributes to angular momentum if there's no spin?,Mass and acceleration,Mass and torque,Inertia and rotation,"Mass, velocity, and offset from a point",D,"Even without spinning, linear motion at a distance from a point creates angular momentum."
Which object has angular momentum without rotating?,A hanging pendulum,A spinning top,A car driving past a streetlamp,A still rock,C,Motion past a point generates angular momentum about that point.
Which equation shows angular momentum from linear motion?,L = I·ω,L = F·d,L = m·v·r,L = m·a·t,C,L = m·v·r⊥ shows angular momentum from a moving object relative to a point.
Which of the following best disproves 'only rotating objects have angular momentum'?,A satellite orbiting a planet,A disc spinning in place,A mass on a spring,A falling object,A,"A satellite has angular momentum due to its path and speed, not because it's spinning."
Why does a puck sliding near a post have angular momentum?,It spins briefly,Its velocity is at a distance from the post,It has inertia,It exerts torque,B,Angular momentum exists relative to a point because of the puck’s velocity and position offset.
What is required for angular momentum in a non-rotating object?,Linear speed and an axis offset,Rotational inertia,Center of mass shift,Increasing torque,A,Linear motion and distance from a reference point create angular momentum.
A student says only spinning objects have angular momentum. What’s the correction?,All objects have it,Angular velocity isn't needed,It's only in circular motion,Linear motion can also create it about a point,D,Angular momentum can be caused by linear motion about a fixed point — not just spin.
What makes an object’s motion cause angular momentum relative to a point?,Torque,Mass,Spin rate,Offset and velocity,D,A combination of distance and linear motion gives rise to angular momentum about a point.
