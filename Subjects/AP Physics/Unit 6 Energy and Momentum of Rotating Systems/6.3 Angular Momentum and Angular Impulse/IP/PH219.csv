Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can an object have angular momentum even if it isn’t spinning?,"No, it must be rotating",Only spinning objects have angular momentum,"Yes, if it's moving relative to a point",Only if mass is changing,C,Linear motion can contribute to angular momentum when measured from a point off the object's path.
Which situation involves angular momentum without rotation?,A ball rolling in a straight line,A mass moving past a fixed point,A car turning a corner,A spinning top,B,Any object moving with velocity relative to a point has angular momentum even if not spinning.
What does angular momentum depend on when there's no rotation?,Mass and velocity,Velocity and distance to a point,Force and displacement,Torque and inertia,B,Angular momentum about a point depends on speed and distance from that point.
A student says only spinning things have angular momentum. What’s the fix?,Only torques matter,Only when ω > 0,Mass must spin,Angular momentum also comes from linear motion,D,Moving mass near a reference point creates angular momentum: L = m·v·r_perpendicular.
A car drives past a flagpole. What kind of angular quantity does it have?,None,Rotational inertia,Angular momentum about the pole,Centripetal force,C,Its linear motion relative to the flagpole gives it angular momentum around that point.
Which of these has angular momentum even without spinning?,Falling object with no mass,Spinning disk,Object hanging still,Sliding puck near a post,D,The puck’s motion past a point gives it angular momentum relative to that point.
What contributes to angular momentum in linear systems?,"Mass, speed, and distance to the point",Speed and direction,Mass and radius,Velocity and force,A,"Angular momentum from linear motion depends on mass, speed, and how far it is from the point of interest."
Which of the following would increase angular momentum about a fixed point?,Moving faster at a greater distance,Moving slower,Getting closer to the point,Spinning faster,A,Greater speed and distance from the point both increase angular momentum from linear motion.
Why does a bullet passing a post have angular momentum?,It spins,It has torque,It has velocity at a distance from the post,It accelerates,C,"Angular momentum exists because it moves past the post at a distance, even without spin."
What is the best way to describe angular momentum in non-rotating systems?,It’s based on motion relative to a point,It depends on energy,It depends on ω,It doesn’t exist,A,"Angular momentum arises from the motion of mass at a distance from a reference point, even without spin."
