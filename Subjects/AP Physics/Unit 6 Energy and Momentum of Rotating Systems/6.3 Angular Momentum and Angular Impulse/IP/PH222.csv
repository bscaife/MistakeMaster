Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Is angular momentum a vector or a scalar?,Scalar,It depends,Vector,Neither,C,Angular momentum has direction — it is a vector quantity just like linear momentum.
What property of angular momentum makes it a vector?,Its magnitude,It points in a direction based on rotation,Its relationship to torque,Its dependence on radius,B,The direction of angular momentum depends on the rotation axis and direction.
Which quantity is a vector?,Kinetic energy,Speed,Angular momentum,Mass,C,Angular momentum is directional and follows vector addition rules.
Which situation proves angular momentum is not a scalar?,Two opposite spins cancel,It depends on mass,It increases with speed,It is based on energy,A,"If two angular momenta point in opposite directions, they cancel — a scalar couldn’t do that."
What determines the direction of angular momentum?,Spin direction,Speed,Mass and radius,Kinetic energy,A,The direction of spin (clockwise or counterclockwise) defines the direction of angular momentum.
Why can angular momenta cancel?,Because they are scalars,Because they are vectors,Because they store energy,Because they affect mass,B,Vectors cancel when pointed in opposite directions — this applies to angular momentum.
Which of the following has directional angular momentum?,A block at rest,A falling ball,A spinning top,A non-moving spring,C,A spinning object has angular momentum with direction based on its axis of rotation.
How is angular momentum similar to linear momentum?,They are both vectors,They both ignore direction,They are both conserved if mass is constant,They both use energy,A,Both are vector quantities — they have magnitude and direction.
A student says angular momentum only has magnitude. What’s the fix?,It depends on radius,It’s a special kind of scalar,It's always clockwise,It has direction based on axis of spin,D,Angular momentum direction depends on the spin axis — not just size.
What happens if two equal spins are in opposite directions?,They double,They square,They add as scalars,They cancel,D,Opposing angular momentum vectors cancel — this proves it's a vector.
