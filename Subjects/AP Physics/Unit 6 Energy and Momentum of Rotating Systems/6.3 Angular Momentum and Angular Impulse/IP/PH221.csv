Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is angular impulse?,Torque,Torque divided by time,Change in energy,Torque multiplied by time,D,"Angular impulse = torque × time, just like linear impulse is force × time."
Which expression defines angular impulse?,J = τ·t,J = I·ω,J = τ,J = τ + θ,A,Angular impulse is the product of constant torque and the time it acts: J = τ·t.
A student says angular impulse equals torque. What’s missing?,Angle,Mass,Time,Velocity,C,Torque must act over time to produce angular impulse.
Which of the following increases angular impulse?,Smaller radius,Shorter time,Larger torque or longer time,Lower mass,C,Angular impulse = τ·t — increasing either factor increases impulse.
Which quantity changes due to angular impulse?,Torque,Rotational KE,Angular velocity,Angular momentum,D,Angular impulse causes a change in angular momentum: J = ΔL.
"If τ is large but t is small, what is the impulse?",Very large,Still depends on product τ·t,Zero,Moderate,B,Impulse depends on both torque and time — large τ alone isn't enough.
Which unit matches angular impulse?,kg·m/s,N·m·s,N·m,kg·m²/s,B,Torque (N·m) × time (s) gives N·m·s — the unit for angular impulse.
Which scenario demonstrates angular impulse?,Constant friction,Constant speed,Constant torque for 3 seconds,Fixed angular position,C,Torque applied over time builds angular impulse and changes momentum.
What happens if torque is applied for longer time?,Impulse increases,Angular KE decreases,Rotation stops,ω becomes zero,A,More time under constant torque increases total angular impulse.
Which equation best connects torque to momentum change?,F = ma,τ·t = ΔL,L = I·ω,W = τ·θ,B,Angular impulse τ·t causes a change in angular momentum ΔL.
