Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH204,Rotational kinetic energy is the same as translational kinetic energy,Assumes there's no distinction between energy due to linear motion and that due to rotational motion.
PH205,Only rotating objects have kinetic energy,"Fails to recognize that even without linear motion, rotating systems have kinetic energy due to rotation."
PH206,Rotational kinetic energy depends on linear velocity,Confuses translational velocity with angular velocity when calculating rotational kinetic energy.
PH207,Rotational energy is directional like angular momentum,Mistakes scalar nature of energy for vector-like properties such as direction.
PH208,Center of mass must move for energy to exist,Overlooks that internal rotation can contribute to kinetic energy even if center of mass is stationary.
PH209,All rotating systems have the same energy if they spin at the same rate,Ignores role of moment of inertia; assumes spin rate alone determines energy.
PH210,Rotational kinetic energy doesn't contribute to total energy,Neglects to include rotational terms when calculating total mechanical energy of a system.
PH211,Work and torque are unrelated,"Fails to understand that work can be done by a torque, just as it can be done by a linear force over displacement."
PH212,Rotational work depends only on torque,Ignores that both torque and angular displacement are required for calculating work done in rotational motion.
PH213,Work in rotation is always positive,"Assumes torque always adds energy, not realizing torque in the opposite direction can remove energy."
PH214,Work is the same regardless of the angle,"Does not consider that work varies with the angle of torque application, just as in linear work with force direction."
PH215,Only complete rotations produce work,"Believes that torque must result in full revolutions to count as work, ignoring continuous accumulation of energy over small angular displacements."
PH216,Rotational work is not energy,"Fails to recognize that work done by torque changes rotational kinetic energy, just as linear work affects translational energy."
PH217,Area under a torque graph means nothing,"Overlooks that the area under a torque vs. angle graph equals work done, paralleling force vs. displacement graphs."
PH218,Angular momentum is always conserved,Fails to consider the need for zero net external torque; assumes conservation without checking system conditions.
PH219,Angular momentum depends only on spin,Ignores contributions from linear motion when calculating angular momentum about a point not on the object.
PH220,Only rotating objects have angular momentum,Overlooks that any object with linear velocity and an offset from a reference point can have angular momentum.
PH221,Angular impulse equals torque alone,"Doesn’t recognize angular impulse depends on torque and duration, not torque alone."
PH222,Angular momentum is a scalar,Misunderstands that angular momentum has direction and follows vector rules like linear momentum.
PH223,All angular momentum equations are interchangeable,Uses formulas for rotating rigid bodies in situations where linear/angular motion must be combined differently.
PH224,More torque means more angular momentum instantly,"Fails to consider that angular momentum change depends on both torque and time (impulse), not instantaneous torque alone."
PH225,Angular momentum is always constant,"Assumes angular momentum can’t change, ignoring the role of net external torque on a system."
PH226,Angular momentum can’t exist without rotation,Fails to understand that linear motion can contribute to angular momentum when measured about a point not on the object's path.
PH227,Objects must be connected to exchange angular momentum,"Believes interaction requires physical contact, not realizing torque can arise through forces at a distance."
PH228,Angular momentum changes require changes in speed only,"Ignores that redistributing mass relative to axis (e.g., pulling in arms) can alter angular momentum or angular speed."
PH229,External forces always change angular momentum,"Thinks any force changes angular momentum, not distinguishing between torque (causing rotation) and linear forces."
PH230,Only rigid bodies conserve angular momentum,Doesn’t recognize that non-rigid systems can still obey conservation laws when no external torque acts.
PH231,Moment of inertia is constant for all rotations,"Assumes moment of inertia doesn’t change with shape or mass distribution, even during deformation or reconfiguration."
PH232,Rolling objects slide by default,"Assumes that rolling motion includes slipping unless friction is explicitly mentioned, ignoring 'rolling without slipping' conditions."
PH233,Friction always slows down rolling,Fails to realize that static friction is necessary for rolling without slipping and may not reduce speed.
PH234,Translational and rotational energy are the same,"Confuses or merges the two forms of kinetic energy in rolling systems, failing to distinguish between them."
PH235,Friction dissipates energy in all rolling cases,"Believes any friction results in energy loss, not recognizing that static friction in ideal rolling does no work."
PH236,Only rotation matters in rolling motion,"Ignores the translational motion of the center of mass in rolling systems, focusing only on the spin."
PH237,No friction means rolling still occurs,"Assumes rolling without slipping is possible on frictionless surfaces, overlooking the role of static friction."
PH238,Rolling speed is the same for all shapes,Thinks all objects roll down a ramp at the same rate regardless of mass distribution and moment of inertia.
PH239,Satellites stay in orbit because there is no gravity,"Assumes gravity is absent in orbit, not realizing it is exactly gravity that provides the centripetal force to maintain the orbit."
PH240,Orbits require constant engine thrust,"Thinks satellites must continuously fire engines to stay in orbit, rather than coasting under the influence of gravity alone."
PH241,Satellites are weightless because gravity is zero,"Confuses 'apparent weightlessness' with lack of gravity, ignoring that satellites are in free fall."
PH242,Circular orbits are the only kind of orbit,Fails to recognize that elliptical orbits are more common and governed by the same conservation principles.
PH243,Higher orbits are always faster,Does not understand that orbital speed decreases with increasing altitude due to weaker gravitational pull.
PH244,Gravitational potential energy is zero at Earth’s surface,"Ignores that potential energy is defined relative to infinity in orbital systems, not Earth’s surface."
PH245,The satellite’s energy changes in circular orbit,"Thinks energy fluctuates during circular orbit, not realizing that both kinetic and potential energy remain constant unless acted upon."
