Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"A rotating platform initially spins clockwise. If the angular acceleration is positive, what happens to the rotation?",It speeds up clockwise.,It slows down clockwise.,It spins faster counterclockwise.,It spins slower counterclockwise.,B,"Using τ = I·α, a positive angular acceleration applied to an object rotating clockwise (typically negative angular velocity) causes it to slow down because the torque is acting opposite to the direction of motion. Direction of rotation matters and influences the sign of quantities."
