Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A wheel starts from rest and speeds up with constant angular acceleration. Which equation can be used to find the angular displacement after time t?,θ = ω·t + ½·α·t²,θ = θ₀ + ω·t,θ = ω²⁄α,θ = ω·t,A,"θ = θ₀ + ω₀·t + ½·α·t²; since ω₀ = 0, this simplifies to θ = ½·α·t². Answer A correctly represents this."
A fan with non-constant angular acceleration increases its angular speed irregularly. Which equation is valid for determining its angle after 5 seconds?,θ = ω₀·t + ½·α·t²,θ = ∫ω(t) dt,θ = ω²⁄2α,θ = α·t²,B,"For variable angular acceleration, kinematic equations don’t apply. You must integrate angular velocity, making choice B correct."
An object has a constant angular acceleration α. What is the final angular velocity after time t?,ω = ω₀ + α·t,ω = ω₀·α·t²,ω = ω₀·t + α,ω = α⁄t,A,ω = ω₀ + α·t is the correct equation for angular velocity under constant angular acceleration.
Which equation should you avoid using when the angular acceleration is not constant?,ω² = ω₀² + 2·α·θ,ω = ω₀ + α·t,θ = ∫ω dt,α = dω/dt,A,Equation ω² = ω₀² + 2·α·θ assumes constant angular acceleration and is invalid for changing α.
A rotating wheel has varying angular acceleration. Which method is best to determine the angular displacement over time?,Use θ = ω₀·t + ½·α·t²,Apply angular kinematic equations,Numerically integrate ω(t),Assume constant α,C,"For non-constant α, angular kinematics are invalid. Numerical integration of ω(t) is appropriate. C is correct."
Which condition must be true to apply the equation ω² = ω₀² + 2·α·θ?,Angular displacement is constant,Angular acceleration is zero,Angular acceleration is constant,Initial angular velocity is zero,C,ω² = ω₀² + 2·α·θ is only valid under constant α. C is correct.
A spinning disc accelerates at an increasing rate. What is the best way to compute its change in angle?,Use constant acceleration formula,Use θ = ω·t,Graph angular velocity vs. time and find area,θ = α·t²,C,"If α isn’t constant, graphical integration of angular velocity gives accurate displacement. C is correct."
"If α = 0, which kinematic formula simplifies properly?",θ = ω₀·t + ½·α·t² becomes θ = ω₀·t,ω = ω₀ + α·t becomes ω = ω₀·t,ω² = ω₀² + 2·α·θ becomes ω² = 2·α·θ,θ = α·t becomes θ = 0,A,"With α = 0, θ = ω₀·t + ½·α·t² simplifies to θ = ω₀·t. A is correct."
"In an experiment, angular velocity increases irregularly. Why can't ω² = ω₀² + 2·α·θ be used?",It is dimensionally incorrect,It is valid only for zero α,It is valid only if α is constant,Angular velocity must be zero,C,"This kinematic equation requires constant α. If α varies, the result is invalid. C is correct."
What is wrong with applying θ = ω₀·t + ½·α·t² to a system with nonuniform angular acceleration?,It ignores friction,It assumes constant α,It requires zero ω₀,It requires zero net torque,B,This formula assumes constant angular acceleration α. It fails when α is not constant. B is correct.
