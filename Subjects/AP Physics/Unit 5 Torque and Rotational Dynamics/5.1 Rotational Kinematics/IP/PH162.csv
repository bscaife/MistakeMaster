Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
How is linear displacement (s) related to angular displacement (θ)?,s = r·θ,s = θ⁄r,s = r²·θ,s = θ²·r,D,s = r·θ links angular and linear displacement. Arc length depends on radius and angle in radians.
"A point on a rotating wheel moves 0.5 m along the edge. If the radius is 0.25 m, what is the angular displacement?",2 radians,0.5 radians,0.25 radians,4 radians,C,s = r·θ links angular and linear displacement. Arc length depends on radius and angle in radians.
Which of the following represents a correct relationship between rotational and linear motion?,θ = s⁄r,θ = s·r,θ = s²⁄r,θ = r⁄s,B,s = r·θ links angular and linear displacement. Arc length depends on radius and angle in radians.
A disk rotates 3 radians. What linear distance does a point on the edge (r = 0.1 m) travel?,s = 0.3 m,s = 30 m,s = 3.0 m,s = 0.03 m,C,s = r·θ links angular and linear displacement. Arc length depends on radius and angle in radians.
"If two wheels rotate through the same angle but have different radii, what’s true?",The larger wheel has greater linear displacement (s = r·θ),They both travel the same distance,The smaller wheel travels farther,Radius does not matter,A,s = r·θ links angular and linear displacement. Arc length depends on radius and angle in radians.
What does the relationship s = r·θ assume about the motion?,The object moves along a circular arc with constant radius,The object moves linearly,The radius shrinks over time,θ and s are in different dimensions,A,s = r·θ links angular and linear displacement. Arc length depends on radius and angle in radians.
Why is angular displacement useful in rotational motion?,"It describes how much an object has rotated, and connects to arc length via s = r·θ",It replaces force in circular systems,It changes with torque,It is only used in radians,B,s = r·θ links angular and linear displacement. Arc length depends on radius and angle in radians.
A rod pivots around one end. A point 0.4 m from the axis sweeps an arc of 2 radians. What is the arc length?,s = 0.8 m,s = 2.4 m,s = 0.2 m,s = 1.4 m,A,s = r·θ links angular and linear displacement. Arc length depends on radius and angle in radians.
"When an object rotates, what determines how far a point moves along the edge?",Both the radius and angular displacement (s = r·θ),Only the angular velocity,The mass and radius,Only the radius,B,s = r·θ links angular and linear displacement. Arc length depends on radius and angle in radians.
Which situation best shows the link between θ and s?,Two runners on different lanes of a track run the same angle but cover different distances,A car moves in a straight line,A pendulum swings at constant amplitude,A wheel spins with decreasing speed,D,s = r·θ links angular and linear displacement. Arc length depends on radius and angle in radians.
