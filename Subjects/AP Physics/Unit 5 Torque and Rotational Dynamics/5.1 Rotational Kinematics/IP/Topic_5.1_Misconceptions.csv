Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH162,Angular displacement and linear displacement are unrelated,"Fails to see angular displacement as the rotational analog of linear displacement, and misses their connection through radius."
PH163,Only rotating objects have angular position,"Assumes an object must be spinning to have angular displacement, ignoring that any rotation from a reference orientation counts."
PH164,Angular velocity and acceleration donâ€™t follow consistent sign rules,"Thinks the direction (sign) of angular motion is arbitrary, not realizing clockwise and counterclockwise are mathematically defined."
PH165,Average angular values equal instantaneous values,"Assumes average angular velocity or acceleration always represent values at every point, ignoring variations over time."
PH166,All points on a rotating object move the same way,"Fails to recognize that linear velocity depends on radial distance, even though angular velocity is the same."
PH167,Angular kinematic equations apply to all motion,"Applies angular motion formulas in cases of non-constant angular acceleration, where they are not valid."
PH168,Direction of rotation has no effect on math,"Ignores sign conventions for angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration, which are essential for vector consistency."
