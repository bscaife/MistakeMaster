Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A solid disk rotates at a constant angular speed. Which point has the greatest linear velocity?,The center of the disk,A point halfway between center and edge,A point at the edge of the disk,All points have the same linear velocity,C,"Linear velocity is related to angular speed by 𝑣 = ω·r. Since ω is constant, the farther from the center (larger r), the greater the linear velocity."
Two objects rotate with the same angular velocity. Object A is twice as wide as object B. Which statement is true about their outer rims?,They have the same linear velocity,Object A’s rim moves twice as fast,Object B’s rim moves faster,Their rims have zero velocity,B,"Linear velocity is 𝑣 = ω·r. If r is doubled, then v is doubled, assuming equal angular velocity."
A child walks outward on a rotating merry-go-round without changing its angular velocity. What happens to the child’s linear speed?,It decreases,It stays the same,It increases,It becomes zero,C,"As radius increases, linear velocity increases: 𝑣 = ω·r."
A rotating record player is viewed from above. Which statement is true about linear velocity?,It’s the same at all points,It increases with radius,It decreases with radius,It depends on the angular acceleration,B,Linear speed increases linearly with radius if angular speed is constant (𝑣 = ω·r).
"Two bugs cling to a rotating turntable: Bug X is near the center, Bug Y is at the edge. Which bug has greater linear velocity?",Bug X,Bug Y,They are the same,Depends on angular acceleration,B,"𝑣 = ω·r. Bug Y has a larger r, so greater linear speed."
Which variable causes linear velocity to vary between points on a rotating body?,Time,Radius,Angular acceleration,Angular velocity,B,Tangential velocity varies due to radius: 𝑣 = ω·r. Radius is the only changing factor between points on the same body.
"If angular speed is constant, how does the distance from the center affect linear speed?",It doesn’t affect it,It increases,It decreases,It reverses direction,B,"According to 𝑣 = ω·r, as radius increases, linear speed increases proportionally."
A fan has identical blades rotating uniformly. Which blade tip travels fastest?,All blade tips travel equally fast,The longer blade travels faster,The shorter blade travels faster,It depends on angular acceleration,B,"Tangential speed 𝑣 = ω·r depends on distance from the axis. Longer blades have greater r, so greater speed."
"Two points A and B are located on the same rotating wheel, with B farther from the center. Which has greater tangential speed?",Point A,Point B,They are the same,Depends on their mass,B,"Tangential speed increases with radius: 𝑣 = ω·r. Point B is farther out, so faster."
A rotating hoop and a solid disk have equal angular speeds. Which has the greater edge speed?,The solid disk,They have equal edge speed,The hoop,"None, they don’t move",C,"The hoop and disk have the same ω, but edge speed is still 𝑣 = ω·r, and both share the same r. They have equal edge speeds."
