Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A disk rotates clockwise and speeds up. What is the direction of its angular acceleration?,Clockwise,Counterclockwise,Zero,It reverses,A,"Clockwise rotation is negative. If speeding up, angular acceleration is also clockwise (same direction)."
A wheel is spinning counterclockwise and slowing down. What is the sign of its angular acceleration?,Clockwise,Negative,Zero,Depends on radius,A,Counterclockwise = positive ω. Slowing down means angular acceleration is in the opposite (clockwise) direction.
"If a fan is turning clockwise and slowing down, what is the direction of the angular acceleration?",Counterclockwise,Clockwise,Zero,Depends on torque,A,Slowing down clockwise motion requires angular acceleration in the opposite (counterclockwise) direction.
A rotating object switches from counterclockwise to clockwise. What does this indicate about its angular acceleration?,No angular acceleration,Acceleration changed sign,There is no rotation,Torque is zero,B,Switching rotation direction means acceleration reversed sign to decelerate then accelerate in the other direction (B).
"If an object has a negative angular acceleration and a positive angular velocity, what will happen to its rotation?",It speeds up,It slows down,It reverses,It stops,B,Positive velocity and negative acceleration means slowing down (B).
An object is rotating faster in the clockwise direction. What does this say about the sign of its angular velocity and angular acceleration?,Both are positive,Both are negative,"Velocity is negative, acceleration positive",Only acceleration matters,C,"Clockwise = negative angular velocity. If speeding up, acceleration must also be negative, so velocity negative, acceleration positive is correct (C)."
An object is spinning with increasing negative angular velocity. What must be true about its angular acceleration?,Acceleration is positive,Acceleration is negative,Acceleration is zero,Direction is arbitrary,B,"If angular velocity is becoming more negative, the acceleration must also be negative (B)."
"If an object has positive angular acceleration and negative angular velocity, what does that mean?",Slowing down,They oppose each other,No angular motion,Signs don’t matter,A,Positive α with negative ω means they oppose — the object is slowing down.
What sign do angular velocity and acceleration have when an object spins faster counterclockwise?,Both are positive,"Velocity is positive, acceleration is negative","Velocity is negative, acceleration positive",Signs don’t matter,C,Counterclockwise = positive angular velocity. Increasing speed means both velocity and acceleration are positive (C).
An object spinning clockwise has angular velocity of −3 rad/s and angular acceleration of +1 rad/s². What will happen?,It continues at constant speed,It speeds up,It slows down,Signs don’t matter,C,"Angular velocity is negative, acceleration positive = slowing down. It will eventually reverse (C)."
