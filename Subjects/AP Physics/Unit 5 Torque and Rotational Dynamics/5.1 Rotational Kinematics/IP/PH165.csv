Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A spinning disk increases its angular velocity uniformly from 2 rad/s to 6 rad/s over 4 seconds. What is its angular velocity at t = 1 s?,2 rad/s,3 rad/s,4 rad/s,5 rad/s,C,"Use ω = ω₀ + α·t. With α = (6−2)/4 = 1 rad/s², ω = 2 + (1)(1) = 3 rad/s."
A wheel starts from rest and reaches 20 rad/s in 10 seconds with uniform angular acceleration. What is its average angular velocity?,2 rad/s,10 rad/s,5 rad/s,7 rad/s,C,Average angular velocity is (0 + 20)/2 = 10 rad/s.
"If a fan’s angular velocity increases steadily from 3 rad/s to 9 rad/s over 3 seconds, what is its angular velocity halfway through the interval?",6 rad/s,5 rad/s,4.5 rad/s,3 rad/s,C,"The increase is uniform, so ω = 3 + (6/3)(1.5) = 6 rad/s."
A disk’s angular position is plotted against time and shows a curve increasing in steepness. What can be said about angular acceleration?,Angular acceleration is constant,Angular acceleration is increasing,Angular velocity is zero,No angular acceleration,A,Increasing slope in θ vs. t means constant angular acceleration.
"A wheel rotates with constant angular acceleration. If ω = 4 rad/s at t = 2 s and ω = 10 rad/s at t = 5 s, what is ω at t = 4 s?",8 rad/s,9.5 rad/s,10 rad/s,7.5 rad/s,A,"Use linearity of motion: 10 = ω₀ + α·5, 4 = ω₀ + α·2. Solving gives α = 2 rad/s², ω = 4 + 2·2 = 8 rad/s."
A rotating object has a positive angular acceleration but its angular velocity graph shows a decreasing slope. What does this indicate?,α is zero,α is positive,α is negative,No angular velocity,B,Decreasing slope in ω vs. t means α is positive if curve bends upward.
A turntable rotates with ω = 10 rad/s and α = 0. What happens to ω over time?,It decreases,It remains constant,It increases,It oscillates,B,"With α = 0, angular velocity remains constant."
A graph of angular velocity vs. time shows a line sloping upward. What does this tell us about angular acceleration?,Angular acceleration is constant,Angular velocity is decreasing,Angular acceleration is negative,Angular velocity is negative,A,Positive slope in ω vs. t graph indicates constant angular acceleration.
A wheel’s angular acceleration is constant and positive. What is the angular velocity at the midpoint between t = 0 and t = 6 s?,Equal to average angular velocity,Greater than average angular velocity,Equal to initial angular velocity,Less than average angular velocity,B,"With constant α, instantaneous ω at midpoint exceeds average unless acceleration is zero."
"If an object rotates from 0 to 30 rad/s in 3 seconds under constant acceleration, what is its instantaneous angular velocity at t = 2 s?",10 rad/s,20 rad/s,15 rad/s,25 rad/s,C,ω = ω₀ + α·t = 0 + (30/3)(2) = 20 rad/s.
