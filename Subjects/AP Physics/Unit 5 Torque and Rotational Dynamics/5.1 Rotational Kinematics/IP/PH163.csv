Which of the following best defines angular position?,Orientation of an object relative to a reference line,The speed at which an object spins,The mass of a rotating object,The amount of torque acting on an object,D,"Angular displacement is the change in orientation measured in radians (Δθ), even if not spinning."
"If a rod is turned 180° from its original orientation, what is its angular displacement in radians?",π,π radians,π⁄2,0.5,B,180° is equivalent to π radians (Δθ = π).

Which of the following scenarios represents a nonzero angular position?,A book tilted 60° from vertical,A sliding block on a frictionless track,A car moving in a straight line,An elevator moving upward,D,"Angular displacement is the change in orientation measured in radians (Δθ), even if not spinning."
"If θ is angular position, what variable describes angular displacement?",Δθ,ω,Δθ,τ,C,"Angular displacement is Δθ, the change in angular position."
Which motion yields the greatest angular displacement?,A wheel rotating 3 full revolutions,A car accelerating forward,A ball thrown straight up,A spring compressing and releasing,C,"Angular displacement is the change in orientation measured in radians (Δθ), even if not spinning."
An object rotates counterclockwise from θ = 0 to θ = π⁄4. What is Δθ?,π⁄4 radians,π⁄2 radians,π radians,2 radians,C,"Angular displacement is the change in orientation measured in radians (Δθ), even if not spinning."
Which quantity changes as an object rotates?,Angular position,Linear acceleration,Mass,Gravitational potential,A,"Angular displacement is the change in orientation measured in radians (Δθ), even if not spinning."
What does a nonzero angular position indicate?,The object has rotated relative to its reference line,The object is spinning very fast,The object has constant torque,The object has increasing inertia,B,"Angular displacement is the change in orientation measured in radians (Δθ), even if not spinning."
