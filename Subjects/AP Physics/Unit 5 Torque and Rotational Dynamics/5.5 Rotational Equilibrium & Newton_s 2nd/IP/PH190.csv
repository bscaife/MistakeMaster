Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student sees a beam in rotational equilibrium and says no forces act on it. What’s wrong?,Forces only appear during motion,"There can be forces, but net torque is zero",The net torque is zero,Balanced forces create no net torque,B,"Rotational equilibrium means net torque is zero — forces can still act, but their torques cancel."
Which of the following is true about a beam in rotational equilibrium?,No torque means no gravity,Forces cancel out but can still exist,Only forces on the left matter,It accelerates upward,B,"Even if forces act on an object, if their torques cancel, the object remains in equilibrium."
What does rotational equilibrium mean?,Net torque is zero,All torques cancel,It rotates in place,No angular velocity,A,"Rotational equilibrium means the sum of all torques is zero, not necessarily that the object is stationary."
A beam stays level even though forces act on it. Why?,There is no net force,Net torque is not balanced,Forces are balanced and create zero torque,The beam must be weightless,D,"Balanced forces can produce zero net torque, keeping the beam level even if forces exist."
Why can a beam have forces but still be in rotational equilibrium?,Because no gravity acts on the beam,Forces balance and net torque is zero,Balanced forces create balanced motion,Zero force always means zero torque,B,"Forces can act on a beam, but as long as their torques cancel out, it’s in rotational equilibrium."
A seesaw is balanced but people are sitting on it. Why is that possible?,There are no forces applied,Equal forces cause motion,One force is larger,They cancel each other’s torque,D,"Two opposing people exert equal and opposite torques, resulting in rotational equilibrium despite nonzero forces."
Which scenario shows rotational equilibrium with nonzero forces?,Two equal weights on either end,Only center forces matter,It must be stationary,It's floating due to magnetism,A,"Equal weights at equal distances produce equal and opposite torques that cancel, keeping the system in equilibrium."
What does it mean when the net torque is zero?,It has no angular acceleration,It’s in free fall,It rotates slowly,The object is falling,A,Net torque being zero implies angular acceleration is zero. The object may still rotate at constant speed.
A student says no forces means equilibrium. What’s a better explanation?,It depends on friction,Equilibrium only happens when motion stops,"Torque must be zero, not force",That’s true only in vacuum,C,"Rotational equilibrium depends on net torque, not net force."
Which statement is true for an object in rotational equilibrium?,There are no forces acting,Forces cancel exactly,Net torque equals zero,"All torques are zero, forces don’t matter",C,"Even if forces are present, rotational equilibrium occurs when their torques cancel each other out."
