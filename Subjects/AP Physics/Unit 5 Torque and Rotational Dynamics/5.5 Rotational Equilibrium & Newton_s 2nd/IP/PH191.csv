Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says an object can’t keep rotating unless torque is applied. What’s the mistake?,Angular velocity must be zero,It slows down immediately,Rotation requires gravity,An object can rotate at constant angular velocity with zero torque,D,"Torque causes angular acceleration, not motion itself. Without torque, an object can still rotate steadily."
Which of the following best describes rotation at constant angular velocity?,It means zero angular velocity,Angular acceleration must be nonzero,The axis must be fixed,No angular acceleration occurs,D,"Constant angular velocity implies no angular acceleration, so net torque must be zero."
"If torque on a spinning wheel is suddenly removed, what happens?",It speeds up,It stops instantly,Angular speed increases,It keeps rotating at constant speed,C,"If net torque is removed, no angular acceleration occurs — rotation continues at constant speed."
What does zero net torque imply about an object’s angular velocity?,It means it must stop spinning,It must begin to rotate,Rotation requires mass change,It continues rotating unless torqued again,D,"Zero net torque means no change in angular velocity, so rotation continues as-is."
Why does an object keep rotating even when no torque acts on it?,Rotation requires constant torque,It has balanced mass,Its radius changes,No net torque → constant angular velocity,D,"Due to conservation of angular momentum and Newton’s 1st law, motion continues without torque."
A disk spins steadily. What must be true about net torque?,Net torque is positive,It must be acted on again,Net force is required,Net torque is zero,D,Net torque must be zero since angular velocity isn’t changing.
A student says torque is needed to maintain rotation. What physics law refutes this?,Newton’s 1st law for rotation,Work-energy principle,Hooke’s Law,Angular momentum conservation,A,Newton’s 1st law for rotation says no torque → constant angular velocity.
Why does a bicycle wheel continue to spin after you stop pedaling?,Friction drives the spin,Angular force remains,Momentum pushes the wheel,It continues at constant angular velocity,D,"With no torque or braking, the wheel continues due to inertia and zero net torque."
What keeps an object spinning if net torque is zero?,Torque constantly fuels rotation,Rotation must reverse,The wheel stores energy,Inertia keeps it spinning,D,"Once spinning, inertia maintains rotation unless torque acts to change it."
Which statement is true about angular motion with no net torque?,It must slow down,Speed must decrease,It depends on torque direction,Angular velocity stays constant,D,"Without net torque, angular velocity remains unchanged — this is Newton’s rotational analog to 1st law."
