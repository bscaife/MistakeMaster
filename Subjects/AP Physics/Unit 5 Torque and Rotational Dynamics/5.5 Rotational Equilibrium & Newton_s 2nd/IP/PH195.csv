Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says balance only occurs with forces placed symmetrically. What’s wrong?,Balance requires identical weights,Because of gravity,They cancel linearly,"Balance depends on torque, not symmetry",D,"Rotational equilibrium depends on torque (τ = r·F), not on symmetrical placement of forces."
Can unequal forces placed at unequal distances still balance?,"No, forces must be equal","Yes, if torques are equal","No, symmetry is always needed","Yes, if their torques are equal and opposite",B,Forces can be unequal if their torques (r·F) are equal in opposite directions — symmetry not required.
What determines if a beam is in rotational equilibrium?,Force magnitudes,Equal mass,Center of mass,Torque: force × distance,D,Torque is what determines rotational balance: both force and distance from the pivot matter.
Why do asymmetric force placements sometimes balance a beam?,Only equal forces work,Because mass is conserved,Because angles cancel,"Because τ = r·F, not symmetry",D,Asymmetric forces can balance if the torques they exert cancel: τ₁ = τ₂.
A 20 N weight is 1 m from the pivot. What balances it on the other side?,20 N at 1 m,40 N at 1 m,20 N at 2 m,40 N at 0.5 m,D,"20 N × 1 m = 20 N·m, so a balancing force could be 40 N × 0.5 m = 20 N·m."
A seesaw balances even though one child is closer to the pivot. Why?,The children must be equal distance,They weigh the same,The heavier child pushes more,The closer child is heavier,D,Different distances are fine if torques cancel. A heavier child closer in can balance a lighter child farther out.
A student says torques only cancel if weights are equal and symmetric. What’s the correction?,Balance always needs symmetry,Equal weights are needed regardless of position,Symmetry is the only factor,Torque matters more than symmetry: τ = r·F,D,Symmetry is not required — balance happens when clockwise and counterclockwise torques are equal.
Which of the following setups balances a beam?,Two 10 N forces on both sides,Two 5 N forces at equal distances,Two 20 N forces close to center,A 10 N force at 2 m and a 20 N force at 1 m,D,"10 N at 2 m = 20 N·m, 20 N at 1 m = 20 N·m — this balances even without symmetry."
What does balance depend on in a rotational system?,Equal weight on each side,Mass and position,Upward force,The net torque equals zero,D,"Torque determines rotational equilibrium. Symmetry helps sometimes, but it’s not required."
Which best disproves the idea that forces must be symmetric to balance?,A beam with same mass on each end,Equal distances from center,A centered fulcrum with equal masses,10 N force 2 m away balancing 20 N force 1 m away,D,Torque-based examples (like unequal weights at strategic distances) prove symmetry isn’t necessary.
