Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says an object in rotational equilibrium must also be in linear equilibrium. What's wrong?,They always occur together,Because they cancel out,Only if net force = 0,Because torque and force act independently,D,"Torque and force are independent. An object can rotate steadily while accelerating linearly, or vice versa."
Can an object be in rotational equilibrium but not linear equilibrium?,"No, they must occur together","Yes, if torque is zero but net force isn’t",Only if motion is uniform,"Yes, the conditions are separate",B,You can have zero net torque (no angular acceleration) and still have linear acceleration due to a net force.
Can an object accelerate linearly while being in torque balance?,"No, torque must equal force","Yes, if net torque is zero",Only if mass is constant,"Yes, net force and net torque are different",B,Linear motion (acceleration) doesn’t require a torque. Only net force matters there.
What condition defines linear equilibrium?,Net torque = 0,Object isn’t spinning,Zero angular acceleration,Net force = 0,D,Linear equilibrium means no net force — object moves at constant velocity or remains still.
What condition defines rotational equilibrium?,Net force = 0,Forces cancel in opposite directions,Net torque = 0,Net torque = 0,C,"Rotational equilibrium is defined by zero net torque, not net force."
Which of these examples shows linear but not rotational equilibrium?,A balanced seesaw,Two equal masses on a board,A stationary plank,A rod pushed sideways at its midpoint,A,A rod pushed at its midpoint has balanced forces (net force = 0) but may not balance torques.
A block is pulled sideways while rotating at a constant speed. Which equilibrium applies?,Neither applies,Only torque applies,Only rotational equilibrium applies,Both apply independently,C,"If the object spins at constant speed but is being pulled sideways, only rotational equilibrium applies."
Which setup could have zero net torque but nonzero net force?,Two equal forces at opposite ends,A car engine running at constant RPM while accelerating,Rotational motion without translation,A spinning fan mounted on a wall,C,"Net torque = 0 means no change in rotation, even if the object is not in linear equilibrium."
What’s true of an object with unbalanced force but balanced torque?,It won’t move or rotate,It stays in equilibrium,It rotates faster,It accelerates linearly,A,"Unbalanced net force causes linear acceleration, while torque remains balanced so angular velocity stays constant."
Why are angular and linear equilibrium not the same?,They're both caused by gravity,They both require symmetry,They involve the same vectors,"Force affects motion, torque affects spin",A,Linear motion and rotation are governed by different physical conditions — they don’t always occur together.
