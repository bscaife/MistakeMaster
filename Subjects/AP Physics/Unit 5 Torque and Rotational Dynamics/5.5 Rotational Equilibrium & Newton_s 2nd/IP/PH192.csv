Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says equal torques mean equal forces. What’s wrong?,Force always equals torque,Equal torques always mean equal mass,Torque is proportional to mass,Torque depends on both force and distance,D,Torque depends on both force and distance from the pivot (τ = r·F). Equal torques can come from unequal forces if the distances differ.
Which statement is true about torque balance?,Equal forces create balance,Equal torques require same force,Force balance is same as torque balance,Balanced torque can come from unequal forces at different distances,D,You can have balanced torque with different forces if lever arms adjust the rotational effect.
Two different forces can balance a beam if they are placed at different points. Why?,They are the same distance from the pivot,Only angles matter,Forces cancel directly,Because τ = r·F,D,"If the torques they produce are equal and opposite, the beam remains balanced even if the forces differ."
A 10 N force at 2 m and a 20 N force at 1 m keep a plank balanced. Why does this work?,Because 10 = 20,They cancel because 10 N is smaller,Torque depends only on direction,Because 10·2 = 20·1,D,The torque produced by each force (τ = r·F) is the same: 10·2 = 20·1 = 20 N·m.
What determines torque besides the force itself?,Only mass,Only acceleration,Only net force,The lever arm length,D,"Torque = r·F, so both the magnitude of the force and its distance from the axis matter."
Which situation shows balanced torque with unbalanced forces?,Two equal forces on both sides,Only equal masses at equal distances,Two equal forces close to pivot,15 N far out and 5 N close in,D,Different force magnitudes can still produce equal torques if applied at distances that balance out.
"A student says if torques are equal, the forces must be equal. What’s the correction?",Forces and torques are interchangeable,Torque doesn’t depend on force,Torque increases with smaller mass,"Torque = r·F, so force can vary if r changes",D,"Torque and force are related, but torque depends on both force and its distance from the axis: τ = r·F."
"If a light beam balances with 15 N and 5 N forces, what must be different?",Their mass is equal,The angle of application is different,Their velocity is constant,Their distances from pivot must differ,D,"For forces of different magnitudes to balance the torques, they must act at different distances from the pivot."
Which best shows that torque and force are not the same?,Equal weights on equal sides,Equal spring constants,Equal velocity changes,A large force close in vs. small force far out,D,"Two setups with unequal forces can balance rotationally if their torques match (e.g., 5 N at 4 m vs. 20 N at 1 m)."
What is required for rotational equilibrium?,Balanced force magnitudes,Balanced mass across pivot,No forces present,Zero net torque,D,"Rotational equilibrium occurs when net torque is zero, regardless of whether forces are equal."
