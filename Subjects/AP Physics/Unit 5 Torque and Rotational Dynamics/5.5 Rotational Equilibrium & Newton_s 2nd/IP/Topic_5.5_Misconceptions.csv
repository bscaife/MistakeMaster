Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH190,Rotational equilibrium means no forces,"Mistakes zero net torque for absence of force, ignoring that forces can be present but balanced."
PH191,"If torque is zero, angular velocity must be zero","Assumes torque is required for motion to continue, overlooking that constant angular velocity requires zero net torque, not zero motion."
PH192,Balanced torques mean balanced forces,"Confuses torque balance with force balance, not recognizing that torque depends on both force and lever arm."
PH193,Only spinning objects can be in rotational equilibrium,Fails to understand that rotational equilibrium also applies to objects at rest with no net torque.
PH194,Direction of torque doesnâ€™t matter for balance,Ignores that clockwise and counterclockwise torques must cancel for equilibrium.
PH195,Equilibrium means symmetric force placement,"Assumes forces must be placed symmetrically for balance, rather than based on torque conditions."
PH196,Angular and linear equilibrium always occur together,"Fails to distinguish that an object can be in rotational equilibrium but still accelerating linearly, and vice versa."
