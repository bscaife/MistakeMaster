Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says a non-spinning object can’t be in rotational equilibrium. What’s the mistake?,Rotational motion is required,Balanced forces cause it,Only torque from friction matters,"It can be spinning or still, as long as net torque = 0",D,Rotational equilibrium means net torque is zero — this can occur whether or not the object is spinning.
Which condition describes rotational equilibrium?,Angular acceleration must be positive,Constant angular speed is required,It applies only when objects fall,No net torque is acting,D,"When there’s no net torque acting, angular acceleration is zero, indicating rotational equilibrium."
Can an object at rest be in rotational equilibrium?,Only spinning objects qualify,It depends on linear momentum,Net force equals net torque,"Yes, if net torque is zero",C,An object doesn’t need to be spinning to be in equilibrium — it just needs no net torque.
Why can a stationary beam still be in rotational equilibrium?,The object must move to be balanced,No torque acts at all,Gravity has no effect,Net torque can still be zero without motion,D,Stationary objects can be in equilibrium if all torques acting on them cancel out.
What does it mean if net torque on a stationary object is zero?,It must start spinning,It must rotate clockwise,It can stay stationary or rotate at constant speed,It stays at rest,C,Zero net torque means no angular acceleration. Object can remain at rest or spin steadily.
Which of the following is an example of rotational equilibrium without motion?,A ball rolling downhill,A spinning top with changing speed,Wheel speeding up,A plank supported at both ends with weights,D,A stationary plank with balanced torques is a perfect example of rotational equilibrium at rest.
A student says rotational equilibrium means spinning at constant speed. What’s a better definition?,"That’s correct, it must spin",It applies only to moving systems,Only circular motion is allowed,Rotational equilibrium means net torque = 0,D,Rotational equilibrium simply means net torque = 0 — not necessarily spinning.
What must be true for an object not rotating but in rotational equilibrium?,It must begin turning,Angular velocity must increase,It stays in equilibrium if torques cancel,All torques cancel out,C,"If the object is not rotating and net torque is zero, it remains in equilibrium."
Which of the following is a valid state of rotational equilibrium?,Spinning faster and faster,Oscillating pendulum,Being at rest or spinning steadily,"Not rotating, but balanced",C,Rotational equilibrium includes both rest and constant rotational motion.
Which phrase best defines rotational equilibrium?,Angular acceleration is constant,Object stays still,Mass is balanced,Net torque is zero,A,Rotational equilibrium occurs when the sum of all torques acting on the object is zero.
