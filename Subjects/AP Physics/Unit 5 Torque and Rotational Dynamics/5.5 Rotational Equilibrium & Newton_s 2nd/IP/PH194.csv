Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says torques cancel regardless of direction. What’s wrong?,Magnitude is all that matters,Force vectors must point outward,Opposing forces cancel torque,Clockwise and counterclockwise torques must cancel,D,"Torque has direction — clockwise and counterclockwise. For balance, their vector sum must be zero."
What is required for an object to be in rotational equilibrium?,Net torque must be clockwise,All torques must be positive,Equal and opposite torques cancel,Net torque = 0 with opposite direction torques,D,"For rotational equilibrium, the net torque (clockwise + counterclockwise) must equal zero."
Two equal forces act on opposite sides of a pivot. Will the beam balance?,"Yes, always balances",Only distances matter,Not if they’re in the same direction,Only if torques oppose each other,C,Torques in opposite directions cancel. Same-direction torques add and produce rotation.
Why do directions of torque matter in balance?,Only mass affects balance,Direction of force is irrelevant,"If both torques are clockwise, they cancel",Clockwise and counterclockwise torques must oppose,D,Direction determines whether torques cancel or add — only opposite torques cancel.
Which of the following demonstrates torque cancellation?,Equal torques in the same direction,Torque must come from gravity,Only clockwise torques cancel,A 10 N·m clockwise and 10 N·m counterclockwise torque,A,"Equal torques in opposite directions (e.g., clockwise and counterclockwise) cancel and lead to balance."
A student claims torque direction doesn’t matter. How do you respond?,Direction only affects velocity,Torque is always positive,Only magnitudes cancel,Balanced torque requires equal and opposite directions,D,Torque direction matters — equal torques only cancel if in opposite directions (vector nature).
What happens when two equal torques act in the same direction?,They cancel each other,They add together,They neutralize angular momentum,They reinforce each other,D,"Two torques in the same direction add, increasing net torque — not cancellation."
Which statement is true about clockwise and counterclockwise torque?,They must be equal,One must be stronger,Only the lever arm matters,They cancel only if opposite,B,One clockwise and one counterclockwise torque can cancel if they are equal in magnitude.
Why doesn’t a seesaw balance with equal torques in the same direction?,They still cancel,They add up to zero,Because balance needs equal upward forces,Torque must be zero in both directions,A,Torques must oppose to cancel. Equal torques in the same direction add and cause rotation.
What must the vector sum of torque be for an object in equilibrium?,It must be clockwise,Net torque must be negative,Net force is zero,Zero — all torques must cancel,D,"For equilibrium, the vector sum of all torques must be zero — direction is essential."
