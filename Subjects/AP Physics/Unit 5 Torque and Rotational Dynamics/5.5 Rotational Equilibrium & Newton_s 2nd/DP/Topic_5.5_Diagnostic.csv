A uniform beam is balanced at its center. A mass m is hung at distance r on the right. What must be on the left?,C,Same mass at same distance.,False,PH191,Half the mass at half the distance.,False,PH191,Any mass mₗ at rₗ such that mₗ·rₗ = m·r,True,,Torque is not needed.,False,PH193,Rotational equilibrium → τₗ = τᵣ → mₗ·rₗ = m·r
Which condition ensures rotational equilibrium?,B,Net torque > 0,False,PH190,Net torque = 0,True,,Angular velocity = 0,False,PH190,Forces must cancel.,False,PH192,Rotational equilibrium → ∑τ = 0
A meterstick is balanced with a 3 N weight at 20 cm. Where to place 2 N weight?,D,At 20 cm,False,PH193,At 30 cm,False,PH193,At 40 cm,False,PH193,At 70 cm to balance about center (50 cm),True,,3·30 = 2·x → x = 45 cm away from center → 50 + 20 = 70 cm
Which is true about objects in rotational equilibrium?,A,They can be rotating with constant angular velocity.,True,,They must be at rest.,False,PH191,Their mass is constant.,False,PH196,They have no forces.,False,PH192,∑τ = 0 does not require zero rotation— only zero angular acceleration
A seesaw balances a 20 kg child 2 m from pivot. Where should a 40 kg child sit?,C,2 m,False,PH192,4 m,False,PH193,1 m,True,,3 m,False,PH192,Balance torques: 20·2 = 40·x → x = 1 m
What must be true of torque to balance an asymmetric object?,D,It must cancel out gravity.,False,PH193,It must be equal on all sides.,False,PH193,It must be clockwise only.,False,PH192,Total clockwise torque = total counterclockwise torque,True,,Rotational equilibrium: ∑τ_cw = ∑τ_ccw
A student says balanced torques mean no motion. What’s wrong?,B,They're completely right.,False,PH190,Object may still rotate at constant rate.,True,,No forces act at all.,False,PH191,Mass cancels angular velocity.,False,PH196,∑τ = 0 → α = 0— but ω may ≠ 0
Which best explains balance in a mobile hanging system?,C,Equal masses always go together.,False,PH190,All strings must be same length.,False,PH193,Torque from each side must balance about each pivot point.,True,,The system must not rotate.,False,PH192,Balance at each pivot → sum of torques = 0 at each point
A bar is balanced when τ₁ = τ₂. What happens if τ₁ > τ₂?,A,The bar rotates toward τ₁ side.,True,,It remains balanced.,False,PH190,It moves left and right.,False,PH190,It falls straight down.,False,PH190,Unbalanced torque causes angular acceleration toward stronger side
Which equation must be satisfied for rotational equilibrium?,B,F₁·d₁ = F₂ / d₂,False,PH190,F₁·r₁ = F₂·r₂,True,,F₁ + F₂ = r₁ − r₂,False,PH192,F₁·F₂ = r₁ / r₂,False,PH192,τ = F·r → set left and right equal for balance
