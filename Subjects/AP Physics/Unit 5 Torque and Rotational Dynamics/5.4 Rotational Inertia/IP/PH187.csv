Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says rotational inertia doesn't matter until something is already spinning. What's wrong?,It's true — only matters in motion,Inertia changes after motion begins,Rotational inertia only affects speed,Rotational inertia resists angular acceleration from rest,C,Rotational inertia (I) resists angular acceleration even from rest — just like mass resists linear acceleration.
How does rotational inertia affect an object that is just beginning to rotate?,It affects speed only after spinning,It slows the rate of starting rotation,It causes angular velocity to stay constant,It doesn’t apply until there's spin,B,"If an object has large I, it accelerates more slowly under the same torque even if it starts from rest."
What does τ = I·α tell us about starting rotation?,It tells us how fast something is,It means friction dominates,It only matters if object is spinning,It defines angular acceleration from rest: α = τ/I,D,The equation τ = I·α tells us how rotation begins — I resists angular acceleration from zero.
Which object will be hardest to start spinning if all are at rest and have the same torque applied?,A sphere,A disk,They all accelerate the same,A hoop,A,"A hoop has higher I (I = m·r²) than the others, so it's harder to get rotating under the same torque."
Why is it harder to rotate a hoop than a disk of equal mass from rest?,Because torque is unequal,It has more mass,It's because of force application,Mass farther from center increases I,B,"The hoop's mass is farther from the axis, increasing I and requiring more torque to accelerate."
A solid sphere and a ring start at rest. Which accelerates more under equal torque?,The ring,The sphere,They are equal,The disk,A,"The ring has higher I, so it rotates more slowly from rest under equal torque."
Which factor determines how hard it is to start rotation?,Its color,Surface friction,Torque depends on angle,Rotational inertia,C,Rotational inertia is like 'rotational mass' — it resists the start of spinning under torque.
"If no torque is applied, what happens to an object with high I at rest?",It starts rotating anyway,It starts spinning faster,It begins spinning due to inertia,It stays at rest unless τ ≠ 0,D,"No torque means no angular acceleration. Even with high I, the object stays at rest."
A student says only mass matters in how an object starts rotating. What's wrong?,It ignores rotational inertia,Mass alone isn’t enough,Rotational inertia isn't real,Torque must overcome rotational inertia,A,Starting rotation depends on I as well as mass. Torque must overcome I to cause α.
How is rotational inertia similar to mass in linear motion?,It has no connection,Mass and inertia are opposites,They’re both unrelated,It resists angular acceleration like inertia resists linear acceleration,D,"Just as mass resists a push (F = ma), rotational inertia resists angular acceleration (τ = I·α)."
