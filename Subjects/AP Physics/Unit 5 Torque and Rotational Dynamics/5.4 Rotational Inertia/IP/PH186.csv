Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says every point on a spinning object contributes equally to rotational inertia. What's wrong?,That’s true for symmetrical shapes,All mass elements are the same,"Rotational inertia depends on r², so distance matters",Inertia is independent of position,C,Rotational inertia is not uniform — each mass element contributes based on its distance from the axis: I = Σm·r².
Which point on a rotating object contributes most to its rotational inertia?,The point closest to the axis,The center,A point halfway to the edge,The point farthest from the axis,D,"The farther a point is from the rotation axis, the more it contributes to I due to the r² factor."
Why does mass farther from the axis increase an object’s rotational inertia more?,Because torque increases,It has more mass,Because I = Σm·r²,Because of gravity,A,Rotational inertia increases more with mass farther from the axis because r² grows quickly: I = Σm·r².
"A disk and a hoop have the same mass and radius. Which has greater total rotational inertia, and why?","The disk, because it’s solid","The hoop, because it’s hollow",They are equal,Neither—it depends on material,B,"A hoop has all mass at radius r, so I = m·r², larger than a disk's I = ½·m·r²."
What determines how much a point mass contributes to rotational inertia?,Its mass alone,Its speed,Its mass and distance squared from axis,The object’s color,C,Rotational inertia depends on both the amount of mass and how far that mass is from the axis: I = m·r².
How is the rotational inertia of an object calculated?,I = m·v,I = m·a,I = Σm·r²,I = m·r² or I = Σmᵢ·rᵢ²,D,Rotational inertia is the sum of m·r² for each mass element: I = Σmᵢ·rᵢ².
"Two rods rotate about one end. One has mass concentrated at the tip, the other evenly distributed. Which has more I?",Both have the same I,The even one,The concentrated one,Neither—mass is constant,A,"Mass farther from the pivot has greater r², increasing I more than evenly distributed mass."
What happens to rotational inertia if mass is moved outward from the axis?,It stays the same,It decreases,It increases,It quadruples,C,Rotational inertia increases with r² — moving mass outward increases I.
Which of the following affects rotational inertia the most?,The object’s shape,The amount of torque,Its angular speed,The distance from the axis,D,"Rotational inertia is most affected by the distance of mass from the axis, due to the r² term in the sum."
A student says every atom of a rotating object adds the same to I. What’s the correction?,That’s accurate unless it's accelerating,Only outer atoms matter,Each mass adds differently depending on r²,Atoms don’t contribute to I,C,"Each atom’s contribution to I depends on how far it is from the axis, not just its mass."
