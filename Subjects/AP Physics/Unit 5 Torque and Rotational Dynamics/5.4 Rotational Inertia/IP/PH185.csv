Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student claims two wheels with the same torque will spin the same way regardless of shape. What's wrong?,They're right: torque is all that matters,Different shapes respond differently to the same torque,Rotational inertia affects spin speed directly,Torque must be countered by friction,B,"τ = I·α. Shape affects I, which affects angular acceleration even if torque is the same."
"If the same torque is applied to a hoop and a disk of equal mass and radius, which accelerates faster?",The hoop,The disk,They accelerate equally,Neither,C,"The hoop has higher I than the disk. For the same torque, the disk accelerates faster: α = τ/I."
How does rotational inertia affect angular acceleration when torque is constant?,It doesn’t matter,Lower I means lower acceleration,Higher I means slower acceleration,There’s no relationship,B,"As I increases, α decreases for fixed τ: τ = I·α → α = τ/I. So rotational inertia slows angular acceleration."
Which of these would have the slowest angular acceleration if the same torque is applied?,A ring,A solid disk,A solid sphere,A disk and a ring are equal,A,"Ring has highest I for given mass and radius, so under same τ, it rotates more slowly."
Why does a solid sphere rotate faster than a hollow sphere when equal torques are applied?,The torques are different,It is more symmetrical,The solid sphere has lower I,Mass distribution doesn’t matter,C,"Solid sphere has lower I than a hollow one, so α = τ/I is greater for the solid sphere."
Two identical torques are applied to different objects. One has higher I. What’s the result?,Both accelerate equally,The one with lower I spins faster,The one with lower I rotates faster,The object with higher I spins slower,C,α = τ/I. Lower I means higher angular acceleration under same torque.
A student says torque is all that matters for spin rate. Which law contradicts that?,Newton's 3rd Law,Conservation of energy,Hooke’s Law,τ = I·α,D,τ = I·α defines the relationship: angular acceleration depends on torque and rotational inertia.
Why does a ring roll down a ramp slower than a solid ball?,Friction acts more on the ring,The slope is steeper,The ring has a larger moment of inertia,They both have same speed,C,"Ring has higher I, so more energy goes into rotation, less into translational motion."
"What is the relationship between τ, I, and α?",τ = I·v,τ = v/I,τ = I·α,τ = m·a,C,"The equation τ = I·α directly relates torque, rotational inertia, and angular acceleration."
Which of these explains why it’s harder to spin a rod with masses at the ends than one with masses at center?,It’s heavier,The rod has more mass,Mass is distributed farther from the axis,The one with larger I resists more,C,Greater distance from axis increases I. Higher I resists angular acceleration.
