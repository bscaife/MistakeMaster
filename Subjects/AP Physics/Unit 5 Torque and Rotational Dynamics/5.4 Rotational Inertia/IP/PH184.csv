Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says a ring is easier to rotate than a disk because the ring has mass farther out. What’s the mistake in this reasoning?,The student is right: edge mass helps rotation,Torque increases with radius,Objects with edge mass have higher rotational inertia,More mass = faster rotation,C,"Rotational inertia increases with distance from axis: I = Σm·r². A ring has higher I than a disk, so it's harder to rotate."
Which object has the greatest resistance to rotational acceleration if mass and radius are the same?,Solid sphere,Solid disk,Hoop,Ring,D,"The ring has all its mass farther from the axis, so its I is largest: I₍ring₎ = m·r², which resists angular acceleration."
"Two wheels have equal mass and radius. One is a hoop, the other is a solid disk. Which rotates more easily?",The hoop,They spin the same,The disk,Neither—they're equal,A,"A disk has lower rotational inertia than a hoop (I = ½·m·r² vs I = m·r²), so it's easier to rotate."
How does spreading mass farther from the axis affect an object’s rotational behavior?,It makes it easier to spin,It increases rotational inertia,It reduces net force,It changes gravity,B,"When mass is farther from the axis, I increases, making it harder to change rotational motion (I ∝ r²)."
Which design increases rotational inertia the most?,Placing mass at the center,Making the object flatter,Spreading mass outward,Increasing density,C,"Spreading mass outward increases r in I = Σm·r², making the object resist rotation more."
A skater spins with arms outstretched. What happens when they pull their arms in?,They slow down due to air resistance,They move outward due to inertia,Their angular velocity increases,Angular momentum stays the same but inertia decreases,D,"Pulling arms in decreases I, and angular speed increases to conserve angular momentum: L = I·ω."
Why does a ring roll slower down a ramp than a solid sphere with the same mass and radius?,It has a smaller radius,It has a larger radius,Its moment of inertia is larger,The surface causes friction,C,"Hoop has higher I, so more of its potential energy goes into rotation rather than translational motion, slowing descent."
"If two rods have equal mass, which one has a higher moment of inertia?",The short rod,The longer rod,The rod with mass at ends,The rod with hollow core,B,Rotational inertia depends on both mass and distribution. Longer rods or those with mass at the ends have higher I.
Why does a disk with mass concentrated near the edge spin more slowly than one with mass near the center?,It experiences more torque,It's closer to the pivot,Because rotational inertia is higher,The disk is heavier,D,"The farther mass is from the center, the larger its contribution to I. So outer mass increases resistance to rotation."
Which configuration resists changes in rotational motion the most?,A sphere with mass at center,A disk with mass at center,A hoop with all mass at edge,A ring with mass at the outer edge,A,More mass at the edge raises rotational inertia: the object resists angular acceleration more.
