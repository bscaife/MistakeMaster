Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says the parallel axis theorem changes the object's mass. What's wrong with that idea?,It reduces the torque,It changes the shape of the object,It modifies gravitational energy,It redefines mass,B,"The parallel axis theorem modifies I, not m. The mass is constant; only its distribution relative to the pivot changes I."
What does the parallel axis theorem actually adjust?,It adjusts rotational inertia,It adjusts the object's radius,It changes linear inertia,It changes angular momentum,A,The theorem is used to compute the new rotational inertia when the axis is not through the center of mass.
Which equation correctly describes the parallel axis theorem?,I = m·d² + m·v,I = Iᶜₘ + m·v²,I = Iᶜₘ + m·d²,I = Iᶜₘ + d·m²,C,The equation I = Iᶜₘ + m·d² shows that we add m·d² to the object's I at center of mass to get I about a new axis.
"If the pivot is moved farther from the object's center of mass, what happens to I?",I stays constant,I increases,I = 0 at max distance,I increases with distance from center,D,"Increasing distance from the center of mass increases d, and I = Iᶜₘ + m·d², so I increases."
What role does mass play in the parallel axis theorem?,It adds velocity,It changes total mass,It affects the added term in I = I_cm + m·d²,Mass decreases,C,Mass remains constant — it scales the added term when the axis shifts.
How does I change when rotating an object about a point not through its center of mass?,It subtracts from I,I stays the same,It becomes m·d,I = m·r²,C,"When rotating about an axis not through the center, rotational inertia increases: I = Iᶜₘ + m·d²."
A student says m·d² in the theorem increases mass. What’s the real effect?,It increases angular velocity,Mass becomes squared,Mass is rescaled,It increases I based on distance,D,m·d² adds to I but doesn’t change the actual mass — it reflects additional inertia due to offset rotation.
Why is I greater when the axis of rotation is farther from the center of mass?,Mass decreases,Distance reduces moment of inertia,It increases,More mass moves outward,C,I ∝ r². Greater distance from axis increases rotational inertia.
What is the physical meaning of m·d² in the equation I = Iᶜₘ + m·d²?,The torque about the pivot,The new axis velocity,How inertia grows with distance,The total kinetic energy,C,m·d² reflects how moving mass away from center increases rotational inertia.
Which of the following remains constant when using the parallel axis theorem?,The axis of rotation,The shape of the object,Mass of the object,Rotational inertia at the center,C,"Mass remains constant. The axis of rotation changes, but the object's total mass does not."
