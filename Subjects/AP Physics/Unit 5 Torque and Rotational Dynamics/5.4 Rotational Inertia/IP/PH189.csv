Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says rotational inertia points along the axis of spin. What’s the mistake?,It depends on the spin direction,It’s part of angular momentum,Rotational inertia is a scalar,All spin-related quantities are vectors,C,"Rotational inertia (I) is scalar — it has no direction. Torque and angular momentum are vectors, but I is just a magnitude."
"Which of these is a scalar, not a vector?",Torque,Rotational inertia,Angular momentum,Moment arm,B,Rotational inertia is scalar: it resists angular acceleration but doesn’t point in a direction.
What physical quantity tells us how hard it is to change an object's rotation?,Angular velocity,Angular acceleration,Torque,"I, because it depends on direction",D,"Rotational inertia tells how hard it is to change rotation — it’s scalar, unlike vector quantities like τ or L."
Which quantity has no direction but affects rotational motion?,Rotational inertia,Torque,Angular momentum,Centripetal force,A,Rotational inertia is a scalar; it affects motion without needing to point in a direction like torque or angular velocity.
Why is rotational inertia not a vector?,It varies with the axis,It points with the spin axis,Scalars can’t have spin,Only vector magnitudes are used,C,Scalars like mass or I resist change but have no direction. Vectors like torque do have direction.
Which of the following is direction-dependent?,Rotational inertia,Angular velocity,Torque,Mass,C,"Torque, angular velocity, and angular momentum are directional quantities. Rotational inertia is a scalar."
What does the vector τ = r × F describe?,Rotational inertia,Torque,Force,Force vector,B,Torque is defined as τ = r × F — a vector perpendicular to the plane of r and F.
Which is true about I (rotational inertia)?,It depends on direction,It points along the axis,It’s always zero,I is a vector,D,Rotational inertia (I) has only magnitude; it doesn't point in a direction like vector quantities do.
How does rotational inertia differ from angular momentum?,They both have direction,Only torque is scalar,"Rotational inertia is scalar, angular momentum is vector",Angular momentum is a scalar,C,I is scalar and affects rotational resistance. Angular momentum depends on I and ω and has a direction.
Which concept is scalar and measures resistance to angular acceleration?,Rotational inertia,Angular speed,Angular momentum,Angular acceleration,A,"Rotational inertia is scalar and tells how hard it is to rotate something, without any directional component."
