Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Two objects have the same mass: a solid disk and a ring. Which has greater rotational inertia?,The disk,The ring,They are the same,It depends on how the mass is distributed,C,"A ring has more of its mass farther from the axis, so τ = I·α means I is greater for the ring despite same mass."
Why does a hoop take longer to roll down a ramp than a solid disk of the same mass?,The hoop has more friction,The hoop has mass farther out,They start at different times,Because mass distribution affects rotation,A,Hoop has higher I than disk: I₍hoop₎ = m·r² vs I₍disk₎ = ½·m·r². More inertia means slower rotational acceleration.
Which factor affects an object's rotational inertia the most?,The color of the object,The radius only,The amount of mass only,How far the mass is from the axis,D,Rotational inertia depends strongly on the distribution of mass relative to the axis: I ∝ r².
"Why does a solid sphere roll faster than a hoop, even if their masses are equal?",Because it has more mass,Because of air resistance,Because its mass is closer to the axis,Because inertia depends on shape,C,"Even with equal mass and radius, the solid sphere has mass closer to the axis, reducing I and allowing faster roll."
A student says mass alone determines rotational inertia. What disproves this?,Both have same inertia,A heavier object rolls slower,Moment of inertia doesn’t apply here,Distribution of mass changes inertia,D,Two objects with equal mass can rotate very differently if one has mass near the axis and the other far from it.
Which pair of objects have different rotational inertias despite equal mass and radius?,A hoop and a disk,Two spheres,All same-shape objects,Different mass distributions,A,"Despite same mass and radius, shape affects I: I₍disk₎ = ½·m·r²; I₍hoop₎ = m·r². Mass farther out increases inertia."
Two wheels with the same mass and radius roll down a ramp. One accelerates faster. Why?,They have different coefficients of friction,Their speeds are different,The surface is different,One has mass near the center,C,"If one object accelerates faster, it must have lower I. This implies its mass is distributed closer to the axis."
Which configuration has the highest rotational inertia?,A disk,A hoop,A sphere,A ring,B,"Among equal mass objects, the one with more mass farther from the axis has greater I. Ring has most mass at edge."
Why does placing mass farther from the axis increase rotational inertia?,Because the shape changes,It adds to kinetic energy,It changes gravitational force,"Because τ = I·α, and I ∝ r²",D,Rotational inertia increases with r². Mass farther from pivot increases torque resistance: I ∝ Σm·r².
"Two skaters spin: one with arms extended, the other pulled in. Who has greater rotational inertia?",The one with arms extended,The one with arms pulled in,They have equal inertia,Neither—it’s based on mass only,A,"With arms extended, the skater's mass is farther from axis, increasing I. Pulling arms in reduces I."
