Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH183,Rotational inertia is the same for all objects of equal mass,"Fails to recognize that distribution of mass affects rotational inertia, not just the amount of mass."
PH184,Mass far from the axis rotates more easily,"Believes objects with mass spread out rotate more easily, when in fact they have greater resistance to rotation."
PH185,Rotational inertia doesnâ€™t affect acceleration,Ignores that a higher rotational inertia leads to slower angular acceleration for the same torque.
PH186,All points on a rotating object have the same rotational inertia,Does not realize that different mass elements contribute differently based on their distance from the axis.
PH187,Rotational inertia only matters if the object is already rotating,"Thinks rotational inertia is irrelevant unless something is already in motion, not recognizing it affects how motion starts."
PH188,Parallel axis theorem changes the mass of the object,"Misuses the parallel axis theorem, thinking it affects the object's mass instead of its effective moment of inertia."
PH189,Rotational inertia has direction,"Confuses rotational inertia with torque or angular momentum, which are directional vectors, while inertia is a scalar quantity."
