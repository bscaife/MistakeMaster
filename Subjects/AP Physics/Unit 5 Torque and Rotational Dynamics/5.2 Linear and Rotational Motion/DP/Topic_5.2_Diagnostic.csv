A wheel of radius 0.5 m has α = 4 rad/s². What is tangential acceleration?,B,a₍ₜ₎ = 4 / 0.5 = 8 m/s²,FALSE,PH171,a₍ₜ₎ = 0.5 · 4 = 2 m/s²,TRUE,,a₍ₜ₎ = 2 · 4 = 8 m/s²,FALSE,PH171,a₍ₜ₎ = 4² / 0.5= 32 m/s²,FALSE,PH171,Use a₍ₜ₎ = r·α to compute
Why do points farther from axis move faster in rotation?,C,They have more torque.,FALSE,PH172,They are more massive.,FALSE,PH174,They have larger radius → v = r·ω,TRUE,,They have more angular acceleration.,FALSE,PH173,Linear speed v increases with radius: v = r·ω
"In a spinning disc,  what happens to a₍ₜ₎ as you move outward?",D,It decreases.,FALSE,PH171,It stays the same.,FALSE,PH171,It becomes angular.,FALSE,PH173,It increases because a₍ₜ₎ = r·α,TRUE,,Tangential acceleration increases with radius.

A student says angular speed is the same for all points on a wheel. Is this correct?,B,No — it changes with radius.,FALSE,PH170,Yes — angular speed is constant for a rigid body.,TRUE,,No — inner points are slower.,FALSE,PH172,Yes — because linear speed is shared.,FALSE,PH170,"In a rigid object, all points share same ω; linear speed varies."
