Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A solid disk is rotating with increasing angular velocity. Which of the following correctly describes the effect on a point near the rim?,Its angular acceleration decreases as speed increases.,Its linear speed stays constant as angular velocity increases.,Its linear acceleration increases with angular velocity.,Its tangential velocity is unaffected by angular acceleration.,C,"Using v = ω·r, as ω increases and r is constant, v increases. Since angular velocity is increasing, the tangential acceleration also increases as aₜ = α·r. Thus, linear acceleration increases."
"If the angular speed of a wheel doubles, how is the linear speed of a point on its edge affected?",It remains unchanged.,It is cut in half.,It also doubles.,It quadruples.,C,"Using v = ω·r, if ω doubles and r remains constant, the linear speed v also doubles proportionally."
An object spinning faster will cause a point at its edge to...,maintain constant linear speed.,experience increased linear acceleration.,rotate with slower angular acceleration.,decrease tangential velocity.,B,"Since aₜ = α·r, if the angular velocity increases over time, α > 0 and thus aₜ increases proportionally for points farther from the axis."
A fan blade’s angular velocity increases from 2 rad/s to 6 rad/s. Which statement about a point at the tip is true?,Its linear displacement decreases.,Its linear speed decreases.,Its linear speed increases.,It rotates at a smaller radius.,C,"Using v = ω·r, increasing ω leads to increasing v. Since the radius is fixed, the linear speed at the tip increases as ω increases."
"As angular acceleration remains constant, what happens to the tangential acceleration of a point at radius r?",It decreases over time.,It stays constant if r is constant.,It increases only if angular velocity increases.,It increases because radius shrinks.,B,"Tangential acceleration is given by aₜ = α·r. If α and r are constant, aₜ remains constant, independent of ω."
A rotating wheel’s angular velocity increases linearly. Which statement about a point on the rim is true?,Its linear speed remains constant.,Its linear acceleration is zero.,It has both tangential and centripetal acceleration.,It only experiences angular displacement.,C,"Because ω is increasing, aₜ = α·r is present, and centripetal acceleration aᶜ = v²/r exists due to nonzero v. Thus, the point experiences both types of acceleration."
"When ω = 0 and α ≠ 0, what is the tangential velocity and acceleration of a point at radius r?","v = 0, aₜ = 0","v = 0, aₜ ≠ 0","v ≠ 0, aₜ ≠ 0","v ≠ 0, aₜ = 0",B,"v = ω·r = 0 since ω = 0, but aₜ = α·r is nonzero since α ≠ 0. Thus, the point has zero linear speed but nonzero tangential acceleration."
"A wheel spins at 5 rad/s and then at 10 rad/s after 2 s. If its radius is 0.4 m, what is the average tangential acceleration of a point on the edge?",0.5 m/s²,1.0 m/s²,2.0 m/s²,4.0 m/s²,C,"α = Δω / Δt = (10 – 5)/2 = 2.5 rad/s², aₜ = α·r = 2.5·0.4 = 1.0 m/s². Correct answer is B."
Which equation links tangential velocity to angular velocity?,v = r/ω,v = ω²·r,v = ω·r,v = ω/r,C,The relationship is v = ω·r. Tangential velocity is directly proportional to angular velocity and radius.
In what scenario would an object have zero angular velocity but nonzero angular acceleration?,At maximum angular speed,At the start of rotational motion,While rotating at constant speed,While decelerating uniformly,B,"At the start of rotational motion, an object begins with ω = 0 but may have α ≠ 0, causing ω to increase over time. This is analogous to linear acceleration from rest."
