Question,A,B,C,D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A solid disk and a ring roll without slipping down the same incline. Which point on each object has the highest linear speed?,The point at the rim farthest from the surface.,The center of mass.,Every point on the object has the same speed.,The point in contact with the ramp.,A,"Using v = ω·r, points farther from the center have greater linear speed. Only point A is at maximum radius and not in contact with the ground."
A rotating platform has an angular velocity of 3 rad/s. Which statement about the speed of different points is true?,All points on the platform have the same speed.,Points closer to the center move faster.,Points farther from the center move slower.,Points farther from the center have greater linear speed.,D,Linear speed v = ω·r increases with radius. So points farther from the center move faster.
"A child stands on a rotating merry-go-round. Her head is 1.5 m from the axis, and her feet are 1 m from the axis. Which has a greater speed?",Her head.,Her feet.,They are the same.,Speed depends on mass.,A,Linear speed increases with distance from the center: v = ω·r. The head is farther and thus moves faster.
"On a rotating disk, which location moves with the greatest speed?",Halfway between the center and the edge.,At the center.,At the edge.,They are all equal.,C,Linear speed depends on radius. v = ω·r is largest at the maximum radius — the edge.
Two points on a spinning tire are 0.2 m and 0.4 m from the center. What is the speed ratio v₂/v₁?,0.5,1,2,4,C,"Since v = ω·r, the speed ratio is 0.4 / 0.2 = 2."
A fan blade spins at constant ω. Which point travels the farthest in one rotation?,The point nearest the axis.,The midpoint.,The outer tip.,All points travel equally far.,C,Linear distance in one rotation is s = 2π·r. Outer points have greater radius and thus travel farther.
A wheel rotates with ω = 10 rad/s. What is the speed of a point 0.5 m from the axis?,5 m/s,10 m/s,0.5 m/s,20 m/s,A,v = ω·r = 10·0.5 = 5 m/s.
"Two objects spin with same ω. Object A has radius 2r, Object B has radius r. Which has higher edge speed?",Object A.,Object B.,They are equal.,It depends on mass.,A,"v = ω·r. A has twice the radius, so edge speed is twice as large."
Why does the outer edge of a rotating CD move faster than points near the center?,It has higher angular speed.,It experiences less friction.,It has a larger radius.,It weighs more.,C,"Linear speed v = ω·r. The outer edge is farther from the center (greater r), so it moves faster."
What variable causes different points on a disk to move at different speeds?,Mass of the object.,Radius from the axis.,Material type.,Angular momentum.,B,Linear speed varies with radius: v = ω·r.
