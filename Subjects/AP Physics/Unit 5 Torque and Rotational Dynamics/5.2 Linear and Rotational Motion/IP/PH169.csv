Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A solid wheel rotates counterclockwise with angular velocity ω and angular acceleration α. What is the direction of linear acceleration at a point on the rim?,Radially inward,Tangential and clockwise,Tangential and counterclockwise,Perpendicular to α,C,"The point on the rim moves tangentially, and since ω and α are both counterclockwise, tangential acceleration is also counterclockwise."
"An object spins clockwise with angular velocity ω. If its angular acceleration α is counterclockwise, what happens to the speed of rotation?",It increases,It decreases,It remains constant,It reverses direction,B,"Since α opposes ω, it slows the rotation. The object’s angular speed decreases."
A pulley rotates clockwise from rest with angular acceleration α = −2 rad/s². What is its angular displacement after 3 s?,−9 rad,9 rad,−18 rad,18 rad,A,Using θ = ½·α·t² = ½·(−2)·(3²) = −9 rad. Clockwise direction is negative.
A rotating wheel has ω = −6 rad/s and α = +2 rad/s². What is the angular velocity after 2 s?,−2 rad/s,−10 rad/s,+2 rad/s,−4 rad/s,A,ω = ω₀ + α·t = −6 + 2·2 = −2 rad/s. It slows in the clockwise direction.
A disc rotates with a constant angular acceleration. What is the correct sign convention for angular acceleration α if rotation is clockwise and slowing down?,α > 0,α = 0,α < 0,α direction is arbitrary,C,"Clockwise rotation is negative; slowing means α opposes ω, so α is positive if ω is negative."
A gear spins at ω = +10 rad/s and slows to ω = +4 rad/s in 3 seconds. What is α?,−2 rad/s²,+2 rad/s²,+4 rad/s²,−4 rad/s²,A,α = (ω − ω₀)/t = (4 − 10)/3 = −2 rad/s². Acceleration is opposite to the spin direction.
A wheel rotating counterclockwise speeds up. What must be the sign of ω and α?,"ω > 0, α < 0","ω < 0, α > 0","ω > 0, α > 0","ω < 0, α < 0",C,Both ω and α must have the same sign for the object to speed up. Counterclockwise is positive.
"If a disk spins at ω = +5 rad/s and α = −1 rad/s², what is ω after 6 seconds?",−1 rad/s,−5 rad/s,−6 rad/s,−7 rad/s,A,ω = ω₀ + α·t = 5 + (−1)·6 = −1 rad/s. The direction reverses at t = 5s.
A fan slows down from 15 rad/s to 5 rad/s in 5 seconds. What is α?,−2 rad/s²,−1 rad/s²,+2 rad/s²,+1 rad/s²,B,α = (5 − 15)/5 = −2 rad/s². The deceleration is opposite to ω.
Which situation reflects a consistent sign convention?,"Clockwise ω > 0, α > 0","Counterclockwise ω < 0, α < 0","Clockwise ω < 0, α < 0","Counterclockwise ω < 0, α > 0",C,"Clockwise is negative, and consistent signs for ω and α mean speeding up in that direction."
