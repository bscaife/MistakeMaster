Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A wheel spins counterclockwise with angular speed ω and angular acceleration α. What is the direction of its tangential acceleration?,Inward toward the axis,Clockwise along the rim,Counterclockwise along the rim,Perpendicular to the rim and outward,C,"The tangential acceleration points in the direction of increasing angular velocity. Since α is positive and counterclockwise, the tangential acceleration is also counterclockwise, directed along the rim (𝐚ₜ = α·r)."
An object rotates in a circle of radius r with constant angular speed. What is the direction of its acceleration?,Along the direction of motion (tangential),Radially inward (centripetal),Radially outward,Zero acceleration,B,"For constant angular speed, the object has radial (centripetal) acceleration directed inward (𝐚ᵣ = v²⁄r), while tangential acceleration is zero since speed isn’t changing."
Which expression correctly gives the linear (tangential) velocity of a point mass on a rotating wheel of radius r and angular velocity ω?,v = α·r,v = ω²·r,v = ω·r,v = ω/r,C,"Linear (tangential) velocity is related to angular velocity by 𝐯ₜ = ω·r, showing a direct connection between angular and linear quantities."
A student says the centripetal acceleration of a point on a rotating disk is in the same direction as the tangential velocity. Why is this incorrect?,Centripetal acceleration points outward.,Tangential velocity is a scalar.,They point in opposite directions.,They are perpendicular vectors.,D,"Tangential velocity is tangent to the circular path, while centripetal acceleration is radial (inward). These directions are perpendicular at all points during rotation."
"If the angular velocity of a wheel is decreasing, what is the direction of its tangential acceleration?",Opposite the direction of ω,Toward the center,Outward from the center,Same as the direction of ω,A,Tangential acceleration points opposite the direction of angular velocity when an object is slowing down. So 𝐚ₜ = α·r opposes ω.
A disk spinning clockwise slows to a stop. Which vector describes the angular acceleration?,Clockwise,Radially outward,Counterclockwise,Zero,C,"To slow a clockwise angular velocity, the angular acceleration must be in the opposite direction: counterclockwise (negative α)."
"If ω = 3 rad/s and r = 0.4 m, what is the magnitude of tangential velocity?",1.2 m/s,7.5 m/s,0.75 m/s,0.12 m/s,A,Using v = ω·r = 3·0.4 = 1.2 m/s. Tangential speed depends on both radius and angular velocity.
The radial direction is best defined as:,Along the path of the object,Tangent to the circular motion,Toward or away from the axis,Parallel to angular velocity,C,"Radial vectors point directly toward (inward) or away (outward) from the center of rotation, contrasting with tangential vectors."
A point on a bicycle tire has zero radial velocity but nonzero radial acceleration. Why?,It is moving tangentially only.,It is at rest.,It is accelerating away from the axis.,Radial velocity and acceleration are always equal.,A,"There is no radial component of velocity during circular motion, but centripetal acceleration (radial) exists, always directed inward."
Which scenario would result in tangential acceleration being zero but centripetal acceleration nonzero?,A ball rolling at increasing speed,A car turning at constant speed,An object sliding to a stop,A rotating fan speeding up,B,"Constant speed turning yields no tangential acceleration (aₜ = 0), but there’s still radial (centripetal) acceleration: aᵣ = v²⁄r."
