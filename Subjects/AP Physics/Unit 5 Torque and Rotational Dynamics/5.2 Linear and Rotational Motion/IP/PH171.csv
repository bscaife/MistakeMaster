Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A disk rotates with a constant angular acceleration α. What is the expression for the tangential acceleration aₜ of a point on its edge located a distance r from the center?,aₜ = r·α,aₜ = α/r,aₜ = v²/r,aₜ = α,A,The formula aₜ = r·α defines the linear tangential acceleration based on angular acceleration and radius.
A disk rotates with a constant angular acceleration α. What is the expression for the tangential acceleration aₜ of a point on its edge located a distance r from the center?,aₜ = α/r,aₜ = r·α,aₜ = α²,aₜ = r,B,Rewriting aₜ = r·α gives aₜ = α/r if you assume inverse proportionality incorrectly.
A disk rotates with a constant angular acceleration α. What is the expression for the tangential acceleration aₜ of a point on its edge located a distance r from the center?,aₜ = ω²·r,aₜ = α²/r,aₜ = r/α,aₜ = ω²,C,"The formula aₜ = ω²·r refers to centripetal acceleration, not tangential acceleration."
A disk rotates with a constant angular acceleration α. What is the expression for the tangential acceleration aₜ of a point on its edge located a distance r from the center?,aₜ = v/r,aₜ = r²/α,aₜ = ω/α,aₜ = v²,D,Tangential acceleration is not aₜ = v/r; this is the formula for angular velocity.
A disk rotates with a constant angular acceleration α. What is the expression for the tangential acceleration aₜ of a point on its edge located a distance r from the center?,aₜ = r²·α,aₜ = α,aₜ = α²·r,aₜ = α²,A,Using aₜ = r²·α is dimensionally inconsistent; the formula must be linear in r.
A disk rotates with a constant angular acceleration α. What is the expression for the tangential acceleration aₜ of a point on its edge located a distance r from the center?,aₜ = α²·r,aₜ = v²/r,aₜ = ω·r,aₜ = ω,A,aₜ = α²·r is incorrect since α is not squared in the relationship.
A disk rotates with a constant angular acceleration α. What is the expression for the tangential acceleration aₜ of a point on its edge located a distance r from the center?,aₜ = α·r²,aₜ = ω²/r,aₜ = v/α,aₜ = r²,C,"aₜ = α·r² assumes a nonlinear dependence on radius, which violates dimensional analysis."
A disk rotates with a constant angular acceleration α. What is the expression for the tangential acceleration aₜ of a point on its edge located a distance r from the center?,aₜ = √(α·r),aₜ = α/r²,aₜ = α·r²,aₜ = α/r,A,aₜ = √(α·r) is non-linear and dimensionally incorrect.
A disk rotates with a constant angular acceleration α. What is the expression for the tangential acceleration aₜ of a point on its edge located a distance r from the center?,aₜ = ω/α,aₜ = α·r,aₜ = α,aₜ = r·α,C,"ω/α is a time, not an acceleration. Incorrect dimensional form."
A disk rotates with a constant angular acceleration α. What is the expression for the tangential acceleration aₜ of a point on its edge located a distance r from the center?,aₜ = r/α,aₜ = α·r,aₜ = α/r,aₜ = √(r/α),B,"Tangential acceleration aₜ is given by aₜ = α·r, not by a square root expression."
