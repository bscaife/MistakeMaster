A uniform disk rotates about its center with angular velocity ω. What is the angular velocity of a point on the edge of the disk?,ω·r,ω²,ω,ω,C,PH172,PH172,PH172,PH172,"All points on a rigid rotating object have the same angular velocity ω, regardless of radius."
A rod rotates with constant angular acceleration α about one end. Which of the following best describes the angular velocity of the midpoint?,It depends on the mass of the rod.,It is the same as the angular velocity at the end.,It is greater than the angular velocity at the end.,It is less than the angular velocity at the end of the rod.,B,PH172,PH172,PH172,PH172,Angular velocity is a property of the entire rigid body in rotation. Every point on the rod has the same angular velocity at a given instant.
A turntable spins with angular velocity ω. What is the angular velocity of a pebble fixed near the center compared to one near the edge?,The pebble near the edge has a greater angular velocity.,The pebble near the center has a greater angular velocity.,The angular velocity depends on their mass.,Both pebbles have the same angular velocity.,C,PH172,PH172,PH172,PH172,"In rigid body rotation, angular velocity is uniform throughout. So both pebbles rotate with the same ω, although their linear speeds differ."
A student says that only the center of a spinning object has angular motion. Why is this incorrect?,Because the center has maximum angular displacement.,Because the center has zero angular acceleration.,Because angular velocity is higher near the edge.,Because angular motion applies to all points on the object.,B,PH172,PH172,PH172,PH172,Every point on a rigid object in rotation shares the same angular motion parameters. The motion is not limited to the center.
An object spins with angular acceleration α. Which equation relates the angular velocity at any point?,x = x₀ + v₀·t + ½·a·t²,v = ω·r,a = α·r²,ω = ω₀ + α·t,A,PH172,PH172,PH172,PH172,"Angular velocity at any point in a rigid rotating body follows ω = ω₀ + α·t. This applies to all points, including the center and edge."
A hoop rotates about its center. Which of the following quantities is constant for all points on the hoop?,Angular velocity,Angular velocity,Centripetal force,Linear velocity,A,PH172,PH172,PH172,PH172,Angular velocity is constant for all points on a rotating rigid body. Other quantities vary with radius.
"A rigid wheel spins with angular velocity ω. A bug sits at radius r, and another at r/2. What is the ratio ω₁/ω₂?",2,1,r/2,1,B,PH172,PH172,PH172,PH172,All points on a rigid body have the same angular velocity. The ratio ω₁/ω₂ = 1.
Which graph best represents the angular velocity of a point on a spinning record over time if the record spins at constant speed?,An increasing line,A horizontal line,An exponential curve,A parabolic curve,A,PH172,PH172,PH172,PH172,"Constant angular velocity means ω does not change with time, so the graph is a horizontal line."
A pulley rotates with angular velocity ω. The string wrapped around it is pulled. What is ω at the top and bottom of the rim?,"Zero at the top, ω at the bottom",ω only at the center,ω at both top and bottom,"2ω at the top, zero at the bottom",B,PH172,PH172,PH172,PH172,"The entire rigid pulley rotates with angular velocity ω, so every point on the rim has the same ω."
Which expression gives angular displacement after time t under constant angular acceleration α?,θ = ω·t,θ = θ₀ + ω₀·t + ½·α·t²,θ = ½·ω·t,θ = v²/r,B,PH172,PH172,PH172,PH172,"The correct rotational kinematic equation is θ = θ₀ + ω₀·t + ½·α·t², valid under constant angular acceleration for all points on the body."
