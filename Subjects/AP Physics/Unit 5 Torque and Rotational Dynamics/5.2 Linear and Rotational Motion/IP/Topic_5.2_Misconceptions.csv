Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH169,Linear and rotational motion are unrelated,Fails to recognize that linear speed and distance can be derived from angular quantities using radius.
PH170,All points on a rotating object move with the same speed,"Assumes equal speed across all points, ignoring that linear speed increases with distance from the axis of rotation."
PH171,Tangential acceleration is the same as angular acceleration,Confuses the rate of change in angular velocity with the linear acceleration felt at a point on the object’s edge.
PH172,Only the center of an object has angular velocity,"Thinks angular motion is localized, rather than applying to all parts of a rigid rotating system."
PH173,Changing angular velocity doesn’t affect linear motion,Doesn’t connect the increase in angular speed to corresponding changes in linear motion at each radius.
PH174,Tangential and radial directions are interchangeable,"Misuses directional terms, mixing up tangential velocity with radial acceleration or centripetal direction."
PH175,Linear formulas apply directly to angular cases,Attempts to use linear motion equations without adjusting for angular quantities and their distinct units and relationships.
