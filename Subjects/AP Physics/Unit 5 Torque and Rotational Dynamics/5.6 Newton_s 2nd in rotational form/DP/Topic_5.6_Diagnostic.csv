Which expression is the rotational analog of Newton’s second law?,C,F = I · α,FALSE,PH197,F = m · a,FALSE,PH197,τ = I · α,TRUE,,τ = m · r,FALSE,PH197,Just like F = m·a— the rotational form is τ = I·α
A wheel with I = 5 kg·m² is acted on by τ = 15 N·m. What is α?,A,α = rad/s²,TRUE,,α = 75 rad/s²,FALSE,PH197,α = 5 / 15,FALSE,PH197,α = 15 × 5,FALSE,PH197,Use τ = I · α → solve for α
An object spins from rest to ω = 10 rad/s in 5 s with constant torque. What is angular acceleration?,D,ω² / r,FALSE,PH197,F / r²,FALSE,PH198,α = ω / 2,FALSE,PH198,α = 2 rad/s²,TRUE,,Change in ω over time gives α
If τ is constant and I triples— what happens to α?,B,It doubles.,FALSE,PH198,It becomes one-third.,TRUE,,It stays constant.,FALSE,PH198,It triples.,FALSE,PH198,α = τ / I → increase I— decrease α
A torque of 12 N·m produces α = 3 rad/s². What is I?,C,I = α / τ,FALSE,PH197,I = τ · α,FALSE,PH197,I = 4 kg·m²,TRUE,,I = τ² / α,FALSE,PH197,Use τ = I·α → solve for I
Which situation best represents τ = I · α?,D,Block sliding on frictionless track.,FALSE,PH199,Mass hanging from pulley without rotation.,FALSE,PH199,Car accelerating linearly.,FALSE,PH199,Disk accelerating under net torque about axis.,TRUE,,τ = I·α only applies to rotational motion about axis
A disk is acted on by τ and experiences α. What is the effect of doubling τ?,A,α doubles.,TRUE,,α halves.,FALSE,PH198,α is constant.,FALSE,PH198,α increases by 4.,FALSE,PH198,Direct relationship: τ = I · α
A student says net torque causes angular velocity. What’s wrong?,C,Angular velocity is mass dependent.,FALSE,PH200,Net torque affects kinetic energy only.,FALSE,PH200,Torque causes angular acceleration— not velocity directly.,TRUE,,Torque is not real.,FALSE,PH200,Net torque → change in angular speed— not speed itself
Which variable must be constant for τ = I · α to apply directly?,D,Radius,FALSE,PH197,Mass,FALSE,PH198,Angular velocity,FALSE,PH201,Moment of inertia (I),TRUE,,Equation assumes I constant for rotating body
Which situation invalidates τ = I · α?,B,Object has fixed mass.,FALSE,PH202,Moment of inertia changes during motion.,TRUE,,Object rotates at constant α.,FALSE,PH199,Force is applied off-center.,FALSE,PH202,Equation applies only if I is constant → changing I requires more complex treatment
