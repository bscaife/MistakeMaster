Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student uses α = (ω - ω₀)/t while torque is changing. What's wrong?,It's fine because time is constant,That equation assumes constant angular acceleration,α always works that way,It's a valid approximation,B,The equation α = (ω - ω₀)/t is derived from constant angular acceleration assumptions.
Why can’t angular motion equations be used when torque is variable?,Because angular acceleration is no longer constant,Because torque is too small,Because θ isn’t measurable,Because mass is changing,A,"Changing torque means changing angular acceleration, which invalidates constant-acceleration equations."
What does θ = ω₀·t + ½·α·t² require?,That torque is constant,That torque is increasing,That ω = 0,That angular velocity is zero,A,"This equation assumes constant angular acceleration, which comes from constant net torque."
Which of these scenarios violates the assumptions of angular kinematics?,Torque is zero,Torque steadily increases,ω = 0,θ is measured in degrees,B,Angular kinematic formulas require constant torque. A changing torque breaks this assumption.
What happens to α when τ varies over time?,It stays the same,It becomes undefined,It becomes linear,It must vary too,D,"If torque changes, then angular acceleration changes: α = τ/I."
What is required for angular motion formulas to be valid?,Constant angular velocity,Variable torque,Constant α,No friction,C,The angular kinematic equations assume constant angular acceleration (α).
"If net torque is increasing, can you use angular kinematics?","Yes, with calculus","Yes, if time is short","Yes, for small intervals","No, because α isn’t constant",D,Angular motion equations require constant α. Changing τ means α isn’t constant.
A student says θ = ω₀·t + ½·α·t² works under variable torque. Why is this wrong?,It gives only average angular displacement,It doesn’t account for force,"It assumes α is constant, which variable torque breaks",It assumes θ is constant,C,That equation assumes constant angular acceleration — not valid if torque varies.
What is α if τ is a function of time?,Constant,Also a function of time,Zero,Same as torque,B,"Since α = τ/I, if τ varies, α must vary as well unless I is also varying in a special way."
Which concept supports rejecting angular kinematics under variable torque?,Constant α requirement,Rotational energy,Angular velocity conservation,Force field rotation,A,"Angular kinematics depend on α being constant — changing torque violates this, making the equations inaccurate."
