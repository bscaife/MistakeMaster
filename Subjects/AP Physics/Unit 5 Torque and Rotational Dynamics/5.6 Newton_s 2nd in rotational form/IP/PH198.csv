Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Why does more torque not always lead to faster rotation?,Because rotational inertia also affects angular acceleration,Because angular velocity must match torque,Because inertia counters speed,Because torque and speed are not related,A,The equation α = τ/I shows that angular acceleration depends on both torque and moment of inertia.
"Two objects get the same torque, but one spins faster. Why?",It has less mass,It has lower rotational inertia,It starts rotating earlier,It has higher torque,B,"According to α = τ/I, lower rotational inertia results in greater angular acceleration."
What must be known to determine how fast an object spins under torque?,Its angular velocity,Its mass,Its radius,Its inertia and the torque,D,The object's angular acceleration depends on both the applied torque and its rotational inertia: α = τ/I.
"If torque increases but the object doesn’t accelerate as expected, what’s likely the cause?",Torque is wrong,Velocity is zero,Distance is small,Inertia is large,D,A high rotational inertia (I) slows the effect of increasing torque: α = τ/I.
A large flywheel and a small disk get the same torque. Who spins faster?,The flywheel,Both the same,The smaller disk,Depends on friction,C,The smaller disk has less rotational inertia and so a greater angular acceleration from the same torque.
Why is it harder to spin up a ring than a solid disk?,More mass,More radius,More moment of inertia,More torque,C,"The ring has more of its mass farther from the axis, increasing I, and decreasing α for the same τ."
What happens to angular acceleration if I doubles and τ stays the same?,α doubles,α becomes zero,α stays the same,α halves,D,"From α = τ/I, doubling I while keeping τ constant causes angular acceleration to be halved."
Which object would resist changes in spin the most?,One with small τ,One with large I,One with no mass,One with equal F,B,A large rotational inertia (I) means more resistance to angular acceleration: α = τ/I.
Why doesn’t more torque always mean faster angular speed?,Because I affects acceleration,Because velocity is vector,Because friction increases,Because mass is zero,A,Angular speed increases only if angular acceleration increases — and that depends on both τ and I.
Which factor directly reduces angular acceleration?,Torque,Mass,Inertia,Speed,C,"Higher I means lower α for the same torque, by the equation α = τ/I."
