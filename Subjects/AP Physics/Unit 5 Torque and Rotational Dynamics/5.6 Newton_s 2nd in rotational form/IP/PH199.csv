Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Can an object experience torque even if it's not rotating?,"Yes, torque can exist before motion",Only if it's free to move,Only when mass is unbalanced,"No, it must already be spinning",A,Torque is a cause of rotation — it can be applied even if the object hasn’t started spinning yet.
A student says torque only applies when something is rotating. What’s wrong?,That’s true,"Torque causes rotation, not the other way around",It causes objects to stop,Torque is only for circular motion,B,Torque initiates rotation — it doesn’t require motion to exist first.
Why might a wrench have torque even if the bolt hasn’t turned yet?,No force is acting,There’s no rotation so no torque,"There’s torque, but friction resists motion",Only gravity acts,C,"Torque may be applied but countered by static friction or constraints, preventing rotation."
What is the correct interpretation of torque?,It measures spin rate,It causes angular velocity,It’s the cause of angular acceleration,It’s rotational energy,C,Torque is defined as the cause of angular acceleration: τ = I·α.
Which equation proves that torque can exist without current rotation?,τ = I·α,F = ma,p = mv,a = v/t,A,τ = I·α describes torque causing angular acceleration regardless of whether an object is currently spinning.
Why might torque be present even when angular velocity is zero?,Because the system is in equilibrium,Because gravity is acting,Because torque initiates rotation,Because motion is constant,C,Torque can be present even at rest — it causes angular acceleration from zero velocity.
How does torque compare to force?,Torque is like force for rotation,They’re interchangeable,Torque only exists in motion,Force includes torque,A,Torque is the rotational analog of force — both can act before motion begins.
What happens if torque is applied to a locked object?,It rotates anyway,There is no torque,It translates instead,It stores potential rotation,D,"The object may not rotate, but torque can create potential for rotation if released."
What’s required for torque to exist?,Angular velocity,Circular mass,Rotational energy,Force at a distance from axis,D,Torque requires a force acting at a distance from the axis: τ = r·F·sin(θ).
"If torque is applied to an object but it doesn’t move, what might be happening?",No torque exists,Torque is being canceled,The object has no mass,Torque is being used as energy,B,"Another torque or constraint may be balancing the applied torque, resulting in no motion despite torque being present."
