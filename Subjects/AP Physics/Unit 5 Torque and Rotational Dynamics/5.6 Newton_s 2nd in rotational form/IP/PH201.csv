Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student says angular acceleration must match the direction of rotation. What's the correction?,That’s true for all circular motion,"Angular acceleration can oppose motion, just like linear deceleration",Angular acceleration causes torque,It reverses spin,B,Angular acceleration is a vector and can oppose the direction of rotation — just like how linear acceleration can slow an object down.
A clockwise-spinning wheel slows down. What is the direction of angular acceleration?,Counterclockwise,None,Toward the center,Clockwise,A,"If the wheel is slowing down, angular acceleration is in the opposite direction of its velocity — counterclockwise."
What does negative angular acceleration mean?,The object is slowing down,The object is speeding up,It changes direction,The object is rotating,A,Negative angular acceleration means the object is slowing down if it's spinning in the positive direction.
Why can angular acceleration point opposite angular velocity?,It can’t — they're always aligned,Because it's slowing the object down,Because torque changes,Because it speeds up spin,B,Angular acceleration points opposite the direction of rotation when the object is decelerating.
Which situation demonstrates angular deceleration?,Fan speeds up from rest,Bicycle wheel coasting faster,Car tire accelerating,A disk spinning slower and slower,D,A disk decreasing in spin rate has angular acceleration opposite its direction of motion.
What’s the relationship between angular acceleration and torque?,They must point opposite,They cancel each other,Angular acceleration follows the direction of net torque,They are both rotational scalars,C,Angular acceleration is caused by torque and points in the same direction as net torque.
"If an object spins counterclockwise and is speeding up, what's the direction of α?",Clockwise,It has none,Counterclockwise,Perpendicular,C,"If the object is accelerating in the direction of motion, angular acceleration points the same way."
What does it mean when α and ω point in the same direction?,The object slows down,It rotates with gravity,It is in equilibrium,It is speeding up,D,"When angular acceleration and angular velocity are aligned, the object speeds up."
Which equation supports understanding angular acceleration direction?,T = 2π·√(L/g),F = m·a,p = mv,θ = ω₀·t + ½·α·t²,D,This kinematic formula helps describe how angular displacement depends on α — including when α is negative.
A wheel spins clockwise and torque is applied counterclockwise. What happens?,It spins faster,It reverses direction instantly,It slows down,It flies off,C,Torque in the opposite direction of rotation causes the wheel to decelerate.
