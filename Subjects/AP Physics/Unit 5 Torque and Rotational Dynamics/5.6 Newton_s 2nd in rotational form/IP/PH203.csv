Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Why can’t torque be used in place of force in F = ma?,They both measure rotation,Torque includes acceleration,Torque applies only to linear motion,Torque and force have different dimensions,D,"Force is measured in newtons (N), while torque is in newton-meters (N·m) — they are not interchangeable."
Which of the following equations uses torque correctly?,F = m·a,p = mv,τ = I·α,F = τ/I,C,"The equation τ = I·α relates torque to angular acceleration, like F = ma in linear motion."
What is the main difference between torque and force?,Force is bigger,Torque is measured in meters,Torque depends on distance from axis,Force causes angular motion,C,Torque equals force times distance from axis: τ = r·F·sin(θ).
A student plugs τ into F = ma. What’s the mistake?,"That equation requires force, not torque",Force and torque are equivalent,It’s okay in circular systems,It’s a rotational form of Newton's law,A,F = ma is for linear motion. Torque must be used with rotational formulas like τ = I·α.
What happens if you replace F with τ in a linear equation?,You get the same result,It works if radius is small,It simplifies the equation,The units will not match,D,"Force is in N, torque is in N·m — swapping them in linear formulas gives invalid results."
Why is torque used in rotational systems?,It works for all motion,It’s easier to calculate,It stores energy,It applies force over distance,D,Torque accounts for how far a force is from the pivot point — it causes rotation.
Which concept distinguishes torque from force?,Torque relates to angular momentum,Torque only occurs in orbits,Torque applies in straight lines,Torque causes translation,A,Torque causes rotational motion and is closely tied to angular momentum.
When does torque become force?,When divided by radius,"Never, they are different quantities",When converted to energy,When mass is zero,B,Torque and force are fundamentally different — they do not transform into one another.
Which statement is true about torque and force?,They are interchangeable,They have different units and contexts,Torque is used for linear motion,Force equals torque,B,Torque (N·m) and force (N) are different and used in separate domains: rotation vs. translation.
What does τ = I·α express?,How force causes spin,How acceleration affects gravity,How torque creates angular acceleration,How force equals torque,C,This is Newton’s second law for rotation — torque produces angular acceleration scaled by inertia.
