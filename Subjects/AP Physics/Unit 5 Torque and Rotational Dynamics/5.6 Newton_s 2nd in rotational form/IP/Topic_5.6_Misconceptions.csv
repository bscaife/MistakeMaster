Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH197,Torque and angular acceleration are unrelated,"Fails to apply Newton’s second law for rotation (τ = I·α), ignoring the proportional relationship."
PH198,More torque always means faster rotation,Does not consider the role of rotational inertia in determining angular acceleration from torque.
PH199,Only moving objects can have torque,"Assumes that torque cannot exist if the object is not rotating, overlooking that torque causes, not requires, rotation."
PH200,Inertia doesn’t matter for angular motion,Overlooks the influence of rotational inertia on how much angular acceleration results from a given torque.
PH201,Angular acceleration must always match the direction of rotation,"Fails to recognize that angular acceleration can oppose motion, slowing an object down just like linear acceleration."
PH202,Angular motion equations apply even with variable torque,Incorrectly applies constant-acceleration angular formulas to situations with non-uniform torque.
PH203,Torque and force are interchangeable in calculations,Tries to substitute torque directly into linear formulas without adjusting for the rotational context or dimensions.
