Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What role does rotational inertia play in angular motion?,It makes motion faster,It resists angular acceleration,It changes velocity,It generates torque,B,Rotational inertia resists changes in angular velocity — τ = I·α shows this relationship.
Why does an object with high rotational inertia accelerate slowly under the same torque?,Because α = τ/I,Because inertia changes,Because torque decreases,Because angular velocity is zero,A,"From α = τ/I, a larger I reduces angular acceleration under constant torque."
Two disks receive the same torque. One accelerates slower. Why?,It has more mass,It has less torque,It has more friction,It has higher rotational inertia,D,The disk with higher I (mass farther from axis) will rotate more slowly: α = τ/I.
How does inertia affect spinning objects?,It resists changes in their motion,It speeds them up,It increases torque,It makes them heavier,A,"Rotational inertia resists angular acceleration, just like mass resists linear acceleration."
What happens when torque is applied to two objects with different rotational inertia?,Both accelerate the same,The one with higher I accelerates faster,They cancel out,The one with lower I accelerates faster,D,"With same torque, the object with lower I has higher α: τ = I·α."
Which quantity determines how much angular acceleration results from a given torque?,Mass,Radius,Rotational inertia,Gravity,C,Rotational inertia (I) affects how much a torque changes angular velocity: α = τ/I.
What is the effect of increasing I while keeping τ constant?,Angular acceleration increases,Angular velocity increases,Angular acceleration decreases,Torque increases,C,"If τ stays constant and I increases, then α must decrease by τ = I·α."
Which object resists spin more?,One with high torque,One with more mass far from axis,One with more mass near axis,One with equal forces,B,"More mass farther from the axis means higher I, leading to more resistance to angular change."
Why can torque result in different angular acceleration for different objects?,Because torque changes direction,Because inertia varies between objects,Because of angular velocity,Because mass is the same,B,The equation α = τ/I shows that angular acceleration depends on the object’s inertia.
Which equation shows that inertia affects angular acceleration?,F = m·a,p = mv,I = m·r²,τ = I·α,D,"The angular equivalent of Newton’s second law is τ = I·α, showing the role of inertia."
