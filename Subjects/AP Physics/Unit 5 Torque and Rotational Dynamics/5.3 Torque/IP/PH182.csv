Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A wrench is turned by applying force 0.3 m from the bolt. A student says torque only applies at the center. Why is this incorrect?,Torque doesn’t apply to bolts,It’s easier to push there,Torque depends on the distance from pivot,Torque is imaginary,C,"Torque is given by τ = r·F, where r is the distance from the axis of rotation—not the center. Applying force away from the center can still create torque."
Torque is applied to a door by pushing it near the edge. Why is this more effective than pushing at the center?,The center is always easier to push,It’s farther from the pivot,Torque increases with radius,Only center forces rotate objects,B,Torque depends on the distance from the hinge (pivot). Pushing at the edge gives a larger lever arm: τ = r·F.
A force acts on the edge of a disk. A student says no torque is produced because the disk's center isn’t touched. What's wrong?,Because circular objects don’t rotate,Force at the center works best,"Torque depends on distance from axis, not center",Only forces through the center matter,D,Torque is not limited to the center. Any force applied at a distance from the pivot can create torque: τ = r·F.
Why do doorknobs tend to be placed far from the hinge rather than near the center of the door?,So it’s easier to see the knob,It looks better,The lever arm is longer,Aesthetics don’t affect torque,C,"The doorknob is placed far from the hinge to increase r, which increases torque for the same applied force: τ = r·F."
In which case is the torque greatest on a rod pivoted at one end?,Near the pivot,Halfway between center and edge,The far end,It doesn’t matter,A,Torque is greatest when the force is applied farthest from the pivot: τ = r·F with r largest at the far end.
A board is pinned at one end. A downward force is applied at the far end. Which point matters for torque calculation?,The center,The edge,Where the force is applied,Nowhere—it has no torque,C,Torque depends on the location where the force is applied relative to the axis. It's not about the center.
A student says that pulling a lever near its pivot gives more torque than pulling at the end. Why is this wrong?,The force is more direct,Because the pivot moves,Because torque depends on r·F,Torque comes from center force only,D,This is incorrect because torque depends on lever arm length. Farther from the pivot increases torque: τ = r·F.
A mass is hung at the edge of a beam. A student says this won’t create torque because it's not at the center. What’s wrong?,There is no force,It balances perfectly,Torque depends on lever arm,Only the center applies torque,B,"Hanging a mass at the edge increases r, which increases torque. Center position is not required to produce torque."
Which factor determines how much torque a force produces?,The size of the object,The force itself,Distance from pivot and force applied,Mass of the object,C,The torque a force produces depends on both the force magnitude and its distance from the axis: τ = r·F.
Which object experiences greater torque: one pushed at the center or one pushed at the edge with the same force?,The center one,They’re equal,The edge one,"Neither, torque isn’t real",B,"With equal force, the edge produces more torque because r is greater. Center force has r = 0, so τ = 0."
