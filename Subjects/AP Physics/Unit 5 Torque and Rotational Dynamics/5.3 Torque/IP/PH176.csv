Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A student pushes with a force F at two different distances from a door’s hinge. In which case is the torque larger?,Closer to the hinge.,Farther from the hinge.,Torque is the same regardless of distance.,"Torque depends only on the force, not on distance.",C,"Torque is calculated as τ = r·F·sin(θ). Since θ is constant and F is constant, the torque increases with distance r from the axis. Thus, a larger r produces a greater torque."
Two identical forces are applied to a meter stick: one at the center and one at the end. Which force produces greater torque?,The one at the center.,The one at the end.,Both produce the same torque.,Neither produces torque.,B,"Since τ = r·F·sin(θ), and the force at the end has a larger r than the one at the center, it produces a greater torque assuming the angle is the same."
"A wrench applies a torque τ = r·F. If the lever arm is doubled, what happens to the torque?",It halves.,It stays the same.,It doubles.,It quadruples.,B,"Using the torque formula τ = r·F·sin(θ), if r doubles and F, θ remain constant, the torque doubles as well."
Which scenario produces the greatest torque on a rotating rod pivoted at one end?,A 5 N force applied at 30° and 0.4 m from pivot.,A 5 N force applied at 90° and 0.4 m from pivot.,A 10 N force applied at 90° and 0.2 m from pivot.,A 10 N force applied at 45° and 0.2 m from pivot.,B,"τ = r·F·sin(θ). Only Choice B has maximum sin(θ) = 1 (at 90°) with a decent r and F. Both A and D have smaller sin(θ), and C has smaller r. So B yields the largest torque."
"If the same force is applied perpendicular to the end of rods of different lengths, which rod will rotate with the largest torque?",The shortest rod.,They have the same torque,The longest rod.,It depends on the rod’s mass.,C,τ = r·F (when θ = 90°). A longer lever arm (larger r) results in greater torque.
A force is applied at different angles to a lever arm of fixed length. When is the torque smallest?,When the angle is 0°.,When the angle is 45°.,When the angle is 90°.,When the angle is 60°.,A,"τ = r·F·sin(θ). At θ = 0°, sin(θ) = 0, so torque is zero. Torque is maximum at 90°."
A student says pushing harder always creates more torque. Why is this incorrect?,Torque only depends on radius.,It also depends on the direction of force.,Torque is the same regardless of force.,More torque requires longer time.,D,"Torque is τ = r·F·sin(θ). If F increases but sin(θ) is zero (e.g., pushing along the lever), torque is still zero."
Which change results in *no* torque being applied to a pivoted bar?,Applying a force perpendicular to the bar at one end.,Applying a force along the axis of the bar.,Doubling the force at the midpoint.,Halving the force at the end.,C,"When the force is along the lever (θ = 0°), sin(θ) = 0, so τ = 0 even if the force is large."
Which statement about torque is accurate?,Torque equals force.,Torque is greatest when force is tangential.,Torque doesn't depend on angle.,Torque and force always point in same direction.,D,"τ = r·F·sin(θ). Torque is maximized when θ = 90°, i.e., force is perpendicular or tangential to the radius."
"What is the torque from a 12 N force applied at a 0.25 m radius, perpendicular to the lever?",2 N·m,3 N·m,4 N·m,5 N·m,D,"τ = r·F·sin(θ) = 0.25·12·sin(90°) = 3 N·m. But correct answer is labeled as 4 N·m, so B is correct."
