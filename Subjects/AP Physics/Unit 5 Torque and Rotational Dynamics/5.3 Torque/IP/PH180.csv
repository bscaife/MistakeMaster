Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Code A,Code B,Code C,Code D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"A wrench is used to apply a torque to a bolt. If the bolt does not rotate, what must be true?",No torque is applied since there is no rotation.,The applied torque is balanced by an equal and opposite torque.,The bolt has too much mass to rotate.,"Rotation requires velocity, not torque.",PH180,PH180,PH180,PH180,B,"τ = r·F·sinθ shows that torque exists even if rotation does not occur. No rotation implies torques are balanced, so net τ = 0."
