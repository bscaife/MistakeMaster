Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A mechanic tightens a bolt using a wrench with a force applied at an angle. Which component of the force creates the torque?,The component parallel to the lever arm,The component perpendicular to the lever arm,The component causing rotation around the axis,All components contribute equally,B,"τ = r·F·sinθ, and only the perpendicular component F·sinθ produces torque."
Which of the following forces would produce the greatest torque about a pivot located at one end of a uniform beam?,A 10 N force perpendicular to the beam at its end,A 10 N force applied diagonally 0.5 m from pivot,A 20 N force at 30° halfway down the beam,A 5 N force 2 m from the pivot at 45°,A,Torque is maximized when force is perpendicular and at the farthest radius: τ = r·F·sinθ.
"If a force is applied parallel to the lever arm, what is the resulting torque?",It is maximal,It is zero,It depends on distance,It depends on angle,B,"If θ = 0°, then sinθ = 0 and τ = 0, regardless of magnitude of force."
A student claims any force on a door causes it to rotate. Which case proves them wrong?,Pushing perpendicularly at the doorknob,Pulling the door with a string tied to its hinge,Holding the door shut,Applying force near the middle of the door,B,"A force through the axis (hinge) gives r = 0, so τ = r·F·sinθ = 0."
Torque is calculated using which component of force relative to the lever arm?,The total force regardless of angle,Only the vertical component of force,The horizontal component of force,Force divided by radius,B,"Torque depends on the perpendicular component, so τ = r·F·sinθ uses only F·sinθ."
Which of the following correctly shows zero torque despite a large applied force?,A force applied 90° from the lever arm,A force applied directly along the lever arm,A vertical force applied at the axis of rotation,A vertical force applied 45° from the radius,C,"Applying a force at the axis gives r = 0, so τ = r·F·sinθ = 0."
What adjustment will increase torque without changing the magnitude of the applied force?,Decrease the lever arm length,Change the angle to be more perpendicular,Change the force direction to be more parallel,Increase mass of the lever arm,B,Making θ closer to 90° increases sinθ and thus torque (τ = r·F·sinθ).
Two equal-magnitude forces are applied at different angles to a rotating disk. Which creates greater torque?,The one applied closer to the axis,The one with the more perpendicular angle,They produce equal torque,The one with the greater mass,B,"Greater angle from radius (closer to 90°) yields greater sinθ, increasing τ = r·F·sinθ."
Why does pushing straight toward a hinge produce no torque?,The force acts at the correct distance,There is no lever arm,There is friction at the hinge,The door is rigid,B,"A force through the hinge has r = 0, so even with F, τ = 0."
An applied force is doubled but the angle becomes aligned with the lever arm. What happens to the torque?,Torque doubles,Torque goes to zero,Torque increases slightly,Torque increases then decreases,B,"With θ = 0°, sinθ = 0, so τ = r·F·sinθ = 0, even though F is doubled."
