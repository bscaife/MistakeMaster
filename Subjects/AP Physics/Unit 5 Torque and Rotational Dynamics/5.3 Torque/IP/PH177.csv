Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation,Code
A student applies a force at an angle θ from the horizontal to a wrench turning a bolt. What equation correctly gives the torque magnitude?,τ = F · r,τ = r · F · cos(θ),τ = r · F · sin(θ),τ = F · sin(θ),C,"τ = r·F·sin(θ); torque depends on the perpendicular component of the force to the lever arm, captured by sin(θ).",PH177
A force of 8 N is applied at 60° to a wrench of length 0.3 m. What is the torque?,0.8 N·m,2.4 N·m,1.2 N·m,2.08 N·m,D,τ = r·F·sin(θ) = 0.3·8·sin(60°) ≈ 2.08 N·m; sine must be used to get correct torque magnitude.,PH177
"If a force is applied directly toward the axis of rotation, what is the resulting torque?",Maximum,Zero,Depends on distance,Infinite,B,"τ = r·F·sin(θ); sin(0°) = 0, so a force directed at the axis provides no torque.",PH177
Which vector condition maximizes torque applied to a rigid body?,Force parallel to the lever arm,Force perpendicular to lever arm,Force directed through axis,Force at 30° to lever arm,B,"τ = r·F·sin(θ); torque is maximized when sin(θ) = 1, which occurs at 90° (perpendicular force).",PH177
"If the angle of force application decreases from 90° to 30°, what happens to torque?",Increases,Decreases,Stays the same,Becomes negative,B,"τ = r·F·sin(θ); as θ decreases from 90° to 30°, sin(θ) decreases, so torque decreases.",PH177
A 10 N force is applied at an angle of 45° to a 0.5 m lever. What is the torque?,3.54 N·m,5.00 N·m,7.07 N·m,0.50 N·m,A,τ = 0.5·10·sin(45°) ≈ 3.54 N·m; must use sin(θ) to correctly account for the angle.,PH177
Which of the following is true for a force applied at 0° relative to the lever arm?,It produces maximum torque.,It produces no torque.,It produces half torque.,It produces torque proportional to cos(θ).,B,"τ = r·F·sin(θ); sin(0°) = 0, so force along the lever arm creates no torque.",PH177
A wrench of length r is used with force F at 90°. What happens to τ if r is doubled?,τ is halved,τ stays same,τ doubles,τ increases 4×,C,"τ = r·F·sin(θ); at 90°, sin(θ)=1, so τ is directly proportional to r.",PH177
You apply the same force at increasing angles to the lever arm. When is τ greatest?,At 0°,At 90°,At 45°,At 180°,B,"τ = r·F·sin(θ); sin(90°)=1 is the maximum value, so torque is greatest at 90°.",PH177
A force of 12 N is applied 0.4 m from pivot at 120°. What is the torque?,2.08 N·m,4.16 N·m,3.46 N·m,0.83 N·m,C,τ = 0.4·12·sin(120°) ≈ 3.46 N·m; torque is proportional to sine of angle.,PH177
