Question,Choice A,Choice B,Choice C,Choice D,Correct Answer,Explanation
A mass is hung on the left side of a balanced meter stick. Where should an equal mass be placed on the right side to keep the stick balanced?,At the same distance as the first mass,Farther from the pivot to add more torque,Closer to the pivot because direction doesn’t matter,"Anywhere, since torque only depends on mass",B,"τ = r·F; the torques must cancel: τₗ = τᵣ → rₗ·mg = rᵣ·mg → rₗ = rᵣ. Since they are opposite directions, correct balance means same torque in opposite directions."
A wrench is being turned with 15 N of force 0.2 m from the pivot clockwise. What torque must be applied counterclockwise 0.3 m from the pivot to balance it?,10 N,15 N,5 N,0 N,C,τ = r·F. Clockwise torque = 0.2·15 = 3 N·m. To balance: τ = 3 = r·F = 0.3·F → F = 10 N.
A student claims two equal forces on opposite sides of a pivot always cause rotation. Why is this wrong?,The magnitudes are too small,Only the mass matters,Directions of torque can cancel,Rotation always occurs,C,"τ = r·F, and torque is a vector: one clockwise, one counterclockwise. Equal and opposite torques cancel, resulting in equilibrium."
"In a torque demo, a light beam stays horizontal when 3 N acts clockwise 0.5 m from center, and 2 N acts counterclockwise. Where is the 2 N force placed?",0.25 m from center,0.75 m from center,0.5 m from center,1.0 m from center,D,Set τ₍cw₎ = τ₍ccw₎ → 3·0.5 = 2·r → r = 0.75 m
Two students each pull on opposite ends of a meter stick with equal forces. It rotates. Why?,One force is stronger,They're at different distances,Torque doesn't cancel,It's unbalanced because one pulls down,B,"Even if forces are equal, different lever arms create unbalanced torques: τ = r·F."
A force of 8 N acts 0.4 m clockwise. A 12 N force acts counterclockwise. How far from pivot must it be for equilibrium?,0.2 m,0.3 m,0.4 m,0.5 m,B,τ = r·F. Set 8·0.4 = 12·r → r = 0.267 ≈ 0.3 m
Which setup results in zero net torque on a seesaw?,Equal weights at different distances,Lighter weight farther from pivot,Heavier weight closer to pivot,Equal and opposite torques,D,"Net torque is the vector sum. Equal and opposite torques (same magnitude, opposite direction) cancel: τ₁ + τ₂ = 0."
A seesaw balances with child A (20 kg) sitting 1.5 m left of center. Where must 30 kg child B sit?,1.0 m right,0.5 m right,1.5 m right,2.0 m right,A,τ = r·F. m₁r₁ = m₂r₂ → 20·1.5 = 30·r → r = 1.0 m
"A plank is in rotational equilibrium. One force is clockwise, one is counterclockwise, and their torques are equal. What is true?",The plank rotates left,The plank rotates right,The plank stays still,The net force is zero,C,Equal and opposite torques → rotational equilibrium: τ₍net₎ = 0. No angular acceleration.
A student argues that adding torque clockwise always causes spin. Which situation disproves this?,A single torque clockwise,A torque clockwise and same magnitude counterclockwise,A force at center,None of these,B,"Equal and opposite torques cancel: net torque = 0, no spin despite torque presence."
