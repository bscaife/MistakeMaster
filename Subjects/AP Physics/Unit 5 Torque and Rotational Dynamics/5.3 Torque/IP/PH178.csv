"A force is applied to a door but it does not rotate. Which explanation is most correct?","No torque is applied since the door isn't rotating.","Torque is applied, but it’s not enough to overcome other torques or inertia.","There can only be torque if motion occurs.","The torque only starts when the door starts moving.","B","τ = r·F·sinθ. Torque can exist without motion; it depends on applied force and position, not resulting rotation."
"A wrench is held stationary while a person applies a force. What can be said about torque?","Torque doesn’t exist without angular acceleration.","Torque is present, even if rotation hasn’t occurred.","Only moving objects can experience torque.","Torque applies only when an object is in motion.","B","τ = r·F·sinθ. A torque is applied due to the offset force, regardless of whether motion follows."
"An object at rest has a net torque of zero. What does this indicate?","No torques exist.","Torques exist but are balanced.","Only linear forces apply.","The object cannot rotate unless it’s already rotating.","B","If Στ = 0, torques can exist but sum to zero, meaning rotational equilibrium without rotation."
"Which of the following can apply torque to an object?","Only a rotating motor.","Only moving objects.","Any force applied at a distance from the axis.","Only if the object spins.","C","τ = r·F·sinθ. Any off-center force causes torque regardless of whether the object rotates."
"What is true about an object under torque that does not rotate?","Torque is zero.","Net torque is nonzero.","There is torque, but it’s balanced by other torques.","Torque requires constant velocity.","C","Objects can experience torques that cancel: τ₁ + τ₂ = 0. Rotation doesn’t prove absence of torque."
"If a force is applied tangentially to a stationary disk but it doesn't spin, what does this indicate?","The force is too small to generate torque.","Torque is zero.","The disk doesn't experience torque.","There is torque, but also balancing torque or friction.","D","τ = r·F·sinθ. Applied torque can be resisted by opposing torque, e.g., static friction."
"A bar is mounted on a hinge. A force is applied at the end but the bar doesn’t move. What’s true?","Torque is not real in this case.","Torque exists and may be balanced.","There is no torque without angular velocity.","Torque is irrelevant if nothing rotates.","B","τ = r·F·sinθ shows torque may exist without motion; net torque = 0 leads to equilibrium."
"Why does a force applied to the center of mass produce no torque?","Torque only exists if something spins.","The lever arm is zero.","The object must be rotating.","The center resists torque.","B","τ = r·F·sinθ and r = 0 at center of mass ⇒ τ = 0 even with nonzero force."
"A seesaw is balanced. What does this imply about torque?","No torque exists at all.","There is torque only if it's rotating.","Balanced torque from both sides keeps it still.","Net force is zero, so torque must be zero too.","C","τ₁ = -τ₂ ⇒ Στ = 0. Balanced torques maintain equilibrium; torque can exist even when static."
"How is it possible for torque to exist without rotation?","It isn’t; rotation is necessary.","Friction prevents force.","Balanced torques cancel rotation.","The object must be accelerating.","C","Equal and opposite torques (τ₁ = -τ₂) prevent net rotation, but both torques still exist."
