Code,Misconception,Explanation
PH176,Torque is the same as force,"Fails to distinguish between force and torque, ignoring the importance of lever arm and rotational axis."
PH177,Torque doesn't depend on angle,"Assumes torque is always maximum regardless of angle between force and lever arm, neglecting the sine dependence."
PH178,Only rotating objects experience torque,"Thinks torque only applies when an object is spinning, rather than recognizing it as a potential to cause rotation."
PH179,All forces cause torque,Does not realize that only the component of a force perpendicular to the lever arm contributes to torque.
PH180,Torque always causes rotation,"Thinks any torque will result in rotation, ignoring cases of torque balance or static equilibrium."
PH181,Direction of torque doesn't matter,Ignores that clockwise and counterclockwise torques can cancel or reinforce each other.
PH182,Torque can act at the center only,"Misunderstands torque as only being relevant at the object's center, instead of at any point offset from the rotation axis."
